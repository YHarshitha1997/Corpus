      "While the manufacture of rubber goods is in no sense a secret industry, the majority of buyers and users of such goods have never stepped inside of a rubber mill, and many have very crude ideas as to how the goods are made up. In ordinary garden hose, for instance, the process is as follows: The inner tubing is made of a strip of rubber fifty feet in length, which is laid on a long zinc-covered table and its edges drawn together over a hose pole. The cover, which is of what is called “friction,” that is cloth with rubber forced through its meshes, comes to the hose maker in strips, cut on the bias, which are wound around the outside of the tube and adhere tightly to it. The hose pole is then put in something like a fifty foot lathe, and while the pole revolves slowly, it is tightly wrapped with strips of cloth, in order that it may not get out of shape while undergoing the process of vulcanizing. When a number of these hose poles have been covered in this way they are laid in a pan set on trucks and are then run into a long boiler, shut in, and live steam is turned on. When the goods are cured steam is blown off, the vulcanizer opened and the cloths are removed. The hose is then slipped off the pole by forcing air from a compressor between the rubber and the hose pole. This, of course, is what is known as hose that has a seam in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For seamless hose the tube is made in a tubing machine and slipped upon the hose pole by reversing the process that is used in removing hose by air compression. In other words, a knot is tied in one end of the fifty foot tube and the other end is placed against the hose pole and being carefully inflated with air it is slipped on without the least trouble. For various kinds of hose the processes vary, and there are machines for winding with wire and intricate processes for the heavy grades of suction hose, etc. For steam hose, brewers’, and acid hose, special resisting compounds are used, that as a rule are the secrets of the various manufacturers. Cotton hose is woven through machines expressly designed for that purpose, and afterward has a half-cured rubber tube drawn through it. One end is then securely stopped up and the other end forced on a cone through which steam is introduced to the inside of the hose, forcing the rubber against the cotton cover, finishing the cure and fixing it firmly in its place.\n",
      "\n",
      "CORRUGATED MATTING.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the mixing of the compound and the calendering, that is the spreading it in sheets, the great roll of rubber and cloth that is to be made into corrugated matting is sent to the pressman. Here it is hung in a rack and fifteen or twenty feet of it drawn between the plates of the huge hydraulic steam press. The bottom plate of this press is grooved its whole length, so that when the upper platen is let down the plain sheet of rubber is forced into the grooves and the corrugations are formed. While in that position steam is let into the upper and lower platens and the matting is cured. After it has been in there the proper time, cold water is let into the press, it is cooled off, and the upper platen being raised, it is ready to come out. A simple device for loosening the matting from the grooves into which it has been forced is a long steel rod, with a handle on one hand like an auger handle, which, being introduced under the edge and twisted, allows the air to enter with it and releases it from the mould.\n",
      "\n",
      "PACKING.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheet packing is often times made in a press, like corrugated matting. The varieties, however, known as gum core have to go through a different process. Usually a core is squirted through a tube machine and the outside covering of jute or cotton, or whatever the fabric may be, is put on by a braider or is wrapped about it somewhat after the manner of the old fashioned cloth-wrapped tubing. The fabric is either treated with some heat-resisting mixture or something that is a lubricant, plumbago and oil being the compound. Other packings are made from the ends of belts cut out in a circular form and treated with a lubricant. There are scores of styles that make special claims for excellences that are made in a variety of ways, but as a rule the general system as outlined above is followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "JAR RINGS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old fashioned way of making jar rings was first to take a large mandrel and wrap it around with a sheet of compounded rubber until the thickness of the ring was secured. It was then held in place by a further wrapping of cloth, vulcanized, put in a lathe and cut up into rings by hand. That manner of procedure, however, was too slow, and it is to-day done almost wholly by machinery. For example, the rubber is squirted out of a mammoth tubing machine in the shape of a huge tube, then slipped on a mandrel and vulcanized. It is then put in an automatic lathe and revolving swiftly is brought against a sharp knife blade which cuts ring after ring until the whole is consumed, without any handling or watching.\n",

      "On the other hand in Italy in the fourteenth century much drawing was\n",
      "done with styles composed of a mixture of lead and tin; drawings that\n",
      "could be effaced with bread crumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Petrarch’s_ Laura was delineated by a contemporary in this manner and\n",
      "in the time of _Michael Angelo_ the process was still in use. These\n",

      "particular name, we know not. In Italy they are called “_Stile_”, but\n",
      "even they never seem at any time to have been the universally\n",
      "acknowledged drawing material.\n",

      "About the same period the pen came into use as a drawing- as well as\n",
      "writing-material, to which were added, in the most flourishing days of\n",
      "painting, black chalk and red chalk which enjoyed extensive use. The\n",

      "\n",
      "This invention, which conferred so many benefits not only upon practical\n",

      "Elisabeth, for in the year 1564 the celebrated blacklead mines of\n",
      "Borrowdale in Cumberland were discovered. With the opening of this mine\n",
      "every element was present to render the developement of an extensive\n",
      "pencil trade upon English soil possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 1565 the _first_ lead pencils were manufactured in England.\n",
      "The mines of Borrowdale, at one time on account of the valuable nature\n",
      "of their produce exposed even to the predatory attacks of the\n",
      "inhabitants of the neighbouring mountains, supply the English down to\n",
      "the present day with the material for the best English leadpencils. The\n",
      "manufacturing of the lead obtained was simple, the material, as soon as\n",
      "it came out of the mine, being cut to the proper size with a saw and\n",
      "then without any further manipulation fastened into the wood and it is\n",
      "remarkable, that the first pencils made in this manner are acknowledged\n",
      "to be decidedly the best and down to the present day unsurpassed by any\n",
      "other manufacture in the softness and delicacy of the lead. Although the\n",
      "Cumberland pencils were soon in great request as being the first to\n",
      "really meet an exigency long felt, it is their excellent quality that\n",
      "has given them their lasting and universal reputation especially in the\n",
      "World of Art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cumberland mine only remained open for six weeks in the year and yet\n",
      "the blacklead obtained in this short time is stated to have been of the\n",
      "value of £ 40,000 or One Million Francs each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The raw material was sent up to London just as it came from the mine and\n",
      "there sold by auction in the _black lead market_, these sales taking\n",
      "place on the first Monday in every month. The price averaged 36-40\n",
      "shillings per English pound and the value of the good Cumberland black\n",
      "lead according to Dufrénoy was 400 Francs per Kilogramme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact of the English Government having considered it expedient\n",
      "rigorously to prohibit the export of black lead in any other form than\n",
      "that of leadpencils goes to prove of what importance these mines and the\n",
      "manufacture of leadpencils in connexion with them was to England. In\n",
      "spite of the fact however that the mines only remained open for six\n",
      "weeks in the year and that no blacklead might be exported from them, the\n",
      "working of the mines, continued as it was for upwards of a century, at\n",
      "last began to have the effect of diminishing the yield, until at last\n",
      "nothing was to be obtained from them but an inferior and impure material\n",
      "no longer adapted as before for the manufacture of pencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to protect themselves from the consequences of a failure of the\n",
      "Cumberland blacklead mines, the English strenuously sought in every\n",
      "direction for new blacklead deposits, but down to the present day\n",
      "without the desired success. There remained therefore nothing but to\n",
      "look about for some means whereby the impure refuse still obtainable\n",
      "could be purified.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process invented for this purpose consisted of first grinding the\n",
      "blacklead to powder as soon as it came out of the mine, then purifying\n",
      "it as much as possible from foreign substances by chemical means and\n",
      "finally compressing it by means of a press in such a manner that the\n",
      "mass could be just as easily cut as the pure Cumberland blacklead used\n",
      "to be. However notwithstanding all the appliances of art and science\n",
      "were brought to bear upon the subject and spite of every exertion to\n",
      "render this composition perfect, the English have not hitherto succeeded\n",
      "in producing any material capable of replacing the natural blacklead as\n",
      "obtained from the Cumberland mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "These circumstances operated as an inducement to search for a\n",
      "substitute, which would admit of a greater economy in the use of\n",
      "blacklead. Experiments were made in England with this view and various\n",
      "substances such as glue, isinglass, tragacanth, gum &c. were tried for\n",
      "the purpose of cementing and consolidating the earthy blacklead into a\n",
      "firm mass. But none of these means succeeded. Subsequently it was\n",
      "attempted to improve the blacklead by melting it with minerals,\n",
      "compounding it with 30 or 40 per cent of sulphur. But this made the\n",
      "blacklead too brittle and the pencils made by this process would hardly\n",
      "mark at all. At last mixing with antimony was tried, which certainly\n",
      "yielded a composition in outward appearance very similar to the pure\n",
      "blacklead, but which proved to be but an unsatisfactory writingmaterial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of last century the manufacture of leadpencils was\n",
      "introduced into _France_ and soon attained to an extensive developement.\n",
      "Hardly were the last restrictions upon industrial freedom removed in\n",
      "that country, when in the year 1795 the idea was started of making use\n",
      "of clay for the purpose of binding the blacklead together. This process\n",
      "soon found favor on account of its many advantages for by this\n",
      "commixture a great portion of the costly blacklead was saved and at the\n",
      "same time the manufacture rendered materially easier, so that the\n",
      "leadpencils could be supplied at a very much cheaper rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "By these novel improvements a fresh era in the manufacture of\n",
      "leadpencils was commenced in France. Notwithstanding this however, there\n",
      "was yet very much to be done in the department of blackleadpencil\n",
      "manufacture in order to keep pace with the increased requirements of\n",
      "advancing art and more civilised life.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, various degrees of hardness and different sorts of pencils were\n",
      "thus obtained but these were by no means proportional to the various\n",
      "modes of use. The manipulation of the brittle material demanded deep\n",
      "study, and conscientious laborers in order to give the pencil the\n",
      "requisite perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we now turn to _Germany_, it will in the first place be necessary to\n",
      "cast a glance at the developement of German industry and German\n",
      "leadpencil manufacture, it being then shown under what circumstances it\n",
      "had to develope itself and with what rivals it had to enter into\n",
      "competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not to be denied that from the very first German industry found\n",
      "itself in a more disadvantageous position. France and England had\n",
      "already become intrinsically industrious countries. They possessed\n",
      "immense facilities for foreign trade, the greatest internal freedom of\n",
      "motion for the industrial element, a legislature which took cognizance\n",
      "of all the requirements of industry, in short both countries were, in\n",
      "comparison with Germany, favored by certain circumstances which are\n",
      "indispensably necessary to render industry flourishing and which were\n",
      "then already fulfilled, whereas in Germany political division and\n",
      "animosity and the pressure of the guilds operated most perniciously upon\n",
      "industrial enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons industry could only develope itself in Germany later\n",
      "and then but slowly. The transition from the old to the new state of\n",
      "things appeared much more difficult, as many long since antiquated\n",
      "forms, which had become endeared to us by use, had first to be\n",
      "abolished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saxon spirit, which, on the other side of the Channel had attained\n",
      "to such glorious results, had to sustain many a conflict in its native\n",
      "land, and many a praiseworthy attempt suffered shipwreck on the many\n",
      "obstacles, which the splitting up of the nation and the retention of\n",
      "unfeasable arrangements opposed to every great idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "German science flourished at the same time to a very great extent, but\n",
      "in its exaltation it stood too high above ordinary life, not perceiving\n",
      "how to associate itself with it, so as to penetrate it with its\n",
      "enlightening and warmthgiving rays. Thus German industry remained far\n",
      "behind foreign enterprise and Germany beheld herself inundated with\n",
      "quantities of foreign manufactures, which she herself could have\n",
      "produced just as well, indeed it came to such a pass that foreigners\n",
      "relying upon their well organised commerce and the celebrity of their\n",
      "products even ventured to send German manufactures into the German\n",
      "market, stamped with a foreign trademark.\n",
      "\n",
      "German industry being at this low ebb, the manufacture of leadpencils\n",
      "occupied but a very modest place. The first traces are to be found in\n",
      "the village of _Stein_ not far from _Nürnberg_. As far back as the year\n",
      "1726 the churchbooks mention marriages of “_Pencilmakers_”, subsequently\n",
      "also “_Blacklead cutters_” male and female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leadpencil making however was then in its very lowest state, as in no\n",
      "case is a large establishment mentioned, and it may be assumed that this\n",
      "branch of trade was only just able to maintain a precarious position in\n",
      "comparison with the English manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bavarian government however soon devoted their attention to this\n",
      "branch of industry and sought to advance it. In the year 1766 a Count\n",
      "von Kronsfeld received a concession for the erection of a leadpencil\n",
      "manufactory at Jettenbach.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the manufacture, wanting as it was in material, experience and\n",
      "custom, still remained so insignificant, that in “Beckmanns\n",
      "Technologie”, which appeared in the year 1777 “Pencilmaking” merely\n",
      "received a quite superficial and incidental notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 1816 the Bavarian government erected a Royal Leadpencil\n",
      "manufactory at Obernzell (Hafnerzell) and introduced into this\n",
      "establishment the French process already mentioned of using clay to\n",
      "consolidate the blacklead.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the new manufacture was in full play, the government transferred\n",
      "the whole establishment into private hands as was intended from the\n",
      "commencement, though the credit of having given the impetus to renewed\n",
      "activity on a large scale certainly belongs to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The establishment is now in the possession of the renowned Regensburg\n",
      "manufacturer. In addition to this the leadpencil manufacture had taken\n",
      "root in Vienna and an establishment was formed there, in which likewise\n",
      "the French process of mixing the blacklead with clay was adopted.\n",

      "The now so extensive _leadpencil manufactory at Stein_ sprung from very\n",
      "modest beginnings. In the year 1760 namely its founder, =Kaspar Faber=,\n",
      "settled in this village of _Stein_ three miles from Nürnberg, and in the\n",
      "year 1761 commenced the manufacture of leadpencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time adverse external circumstances pressed heavily upon the\n",
      "young manufactory, the whole possessions of its founder consisting only\n",
      "of a small house situated on the Rednitz and surrounded by a small\n",
      "garden. A judicial inventory dated 1786 still preserved in the family\n",
      "specifies faithfully the insignificant property possessed by them,\n",
      "showing a nett result of “Fifty nine florins”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The finest and dearest qualities mentioned therein are spoken of as\n",
      "“several gross of _English_ pencils”, for thus the better German\n",
      "manufactures had to disguise themselves under a foreign title. The\n",
      "demand for these manufactures was trifling and purely local, as the\n",
      "spirit of commerce and enterprise did but little to assist their\n",
      "introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nürnberg and Fürth appear to have been the first to patronise the\n",
      "products of the manufactory. To these places, as we know, the pencils\n",
      "finished in the course of the week were carried on Saturdays in a\n",
      "basket; but the fact of their having been well paid for goes to prove\n",
      "that even then their excellence was acknowledged. The relations at that\n",
      "time existing between the producer and the consuming public were however\n",
      "but little regulated. The producer stood by himself alone, cut off from\n",
      "the world, which seemed to him too immensely large for him to dare to\n",
      "step out into it. The farsighted vision, searching in every direction to\n",
      "discover new wants and invent new improvements, were wanting to him, as\n",
      "was also the beneficial influence of external relations, with which he\n",
      "was never brought in contact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was the consumer any more favorably situated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article became the object of extensive commercial speculation and\n",
      "had often to travel a very long way before it reached the hands of the\n",
      "consuming public, nor was the repute of a good name any guarantee to the\n",
      "consumer of the excellence of the article, for in order to keep the\n",
      "manufacturers in complete dependance, the merchants would not allow them\n",
      "to mark their better products with their names, but prescribed them\n",
      "foreign names and unmeaning signs, such as: Harps, Stars etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was but slowly that the French process of mixing the lead with clay\n",
      "gained ground and many years after the adoption of this process the\n",
      "workmen, even in _Faber’s_ manufactory, were still employed in working\n",
      "the Spanish lead in the old fashioned way by melting it and cutting it\n",
      "with a saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "The progress of the French however soon forced the merchants to press\n",
      "the Nürnberg manufacturers to advance, so as not to be left behind by\n",
      "competition. After the introduction of the new composition the Nürnberg\n",
      "manufactories soon found themselves favorably circumstanced and yielded\n",
      "satisfactory profits both to the merchants and the manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was not to last. In the first ten years of this century\n",
      "competition increased steadily and enormously so that demand by no means\n",
      "kept pace with supply, and the vital question forced itself upon the\n",
      "manufacturers, whether they were in a position to produce the article\n",
      "either better or cheaper?\n",
      "\n",
      "This difficult problem was however solved in a manner unfavorable to the\n",
      "manufacture, and with that revolution commences the decay of the same\n",
      "which now began to make itself felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manufacture had, as before observed, become dependant upon the trade\n",
      "of Nürnberg, which however no longer occupied its former high position,\n",
      "for, although a considerable trade with foreign lands still existed, it\n",
      "was to a great extent nominal. The enlargement and correction of ideas\n",
      "by foreign travel and personal acquaintance with the grand advancement\n",
      "in foreign industry, were wanting and thus no beneficial adjustment of\n",
      "the Nürnberg manufacture could be brought about. Manufacture became the\n",
      "shuttlecock of commercial speculation, which could not even so much as\n",
      "claim the credit of having successfully met the increased requirements\n",
      "of the age or put a stop to powerful competition or an overworked system\n",
      "of trade more calculated for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trade of Nürnberg at that time lay in the fetters of the guild\n",
      "system, the relic of an earlier golden time, which, aiming at the\n",
      "isolation of industry, which was thereby given into its hands, was the\n",
      "ban that opposed its progress for a length of time, alluring it to act\n",
      "contrary to the interests of native industry and therefore contrary to\n",
      "its own interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much did this system leave of the ancient splendor and well earnt\n",
      "renown of the City of Nürnberg?—A minimum kept and retained solely and\n",
      "alone by the self denial, frugality and industry of the inhabitants. The\n",
      "ingenious, serviceable articles had disappeared, giving place to goods,\n",
      "whose only recommendation consisted in their being unprecedentedly\n",
      "cheap. The endeavour to manufacture without the least regard to quality\n",
      "or serviceability as long as cheapness was attained had become a rooted\n",
      "evil increasing as it descended in all its fulness from father to son.\n",
      "The honorable distinction of the title “Nuernberg, good” soon became\n",
      "changed into the lasting and contemptuous one of “Nürnberg goods” and in\n",
      "the business world people even went so far as to say that nothing good\n",
      "could possibly be produced at Nürnberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "These circumstances, which are to be laid to the account not only of\n",
      "individuals but likewise of a domineering system and the spirit of a\n",
      "time not so very far distant even now, attest that real industrial\n",
      "activity must go hand in hand with mercantile spirit in order to\n",
      "maintain itself in the world free from the influences above pointed out\n",
      "and enter the lists with competition. It is only emancipated industry\n",

      "leadpencils had not as yet taken firm root there and it therefore became\n",
      "a question of obtaining a generally acknowledged product of European\n",
      "manufacture, the excellence of which had been proved by the experience\n",
      "of years and its honest manufacture.\n",
      "\n",
      "This induced the proprietor of the manufactory to establish a house at\n",
      "_New-York_ and entrust the management of the same to his youngest\n",
      "brother =Eberhard Faber=, who had just completed his study for the law\n",
      "at the universities of Berlin and Erlangen and was at that time engaged\n",
      "in acquiring the necessary mercantile knowledge in the establishment at\n",
      "Stein.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trade with America thereby acquired a firm footing, the\n",
      "communication spite of the great distance became more regular and the\n",
      "connexion of the manufactory with the new world more close. As\n",
      "_England_, _France_, _Russia_, _Italy_ and the East had long since been\n",
      "open to _Faber’s_ manufactures, the idea of creating an universal trade\n",
      "appeared to be realised.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the American commercial metropolis, so also in Paris a house was\n",
      "founded, not merely to manage the important trade with France and the\n",
      "neighbouring countries, but also to minister to the fine tastes and\n",
      "elegant requirements of the French, which are of so much advantage to\n",
      "any product intrinsically excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In like manner, in order to supply the requirements of _England_,\n",
      "_India_ and _Australia_, an agency was established in London in the year\n",

      "On the very spot, where once the little house stood, the extensive\n",
      "factory premises are now erected on either side of the Rednitz, the\n",

      "ornamental considerations, so that the very character of the locality\n",
      "underwent considerable change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gardens now enclose the whole establishment on three of its sides. In\n",
      "one of them stands the residence of the proprietor of the manufactory,\n",
      "_Lothar_, visible from afar by reason of the height of its situation and\n",
      "remarkable on account of the peculiarity of the style of its\n",
      "architecture; in the other the house of his younger brother, _Johann_,\n",
      "so that everything stands together in the closest connexion like the\n",
      "life of a large family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proprietor, while endeavouring in every way to advance all the ends\n",
      "of the manufactory in the most perfect manner, has not omitted to bear\n",

      "whom he has accustomed himself to recognise as men and his fellow\n",
      "creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their interest there were in the first place factory rules drawn up,\n",
      "which regulated the duties and rights of the individual in the most\n",
      "precise manner and especially took cognisance of the moral conduct of\n",
      "the workman. They also gave the most diligent workmen and such as were\n",
      "more advanced in years, opportunities of increasing their income by\n",
      "ensuring them an increase of pay under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to awaken and encourage a spirit of frugality in the men and to\n",
      "render their future more comfortable and independant, a Workman’s\n",
      "Savings _Bank_ was instituted, with the following fundamental\n",
      "principles: Acceptance of the smallest deposit at any time; interest at\n",
      "four per cent to commence as soon as the deposit reaches the amount of\n",
      "five florins; deposits to be withdrawn only on account of some\n",
      "notoriously pressing necessity. This institution found immediate\n",
      "recognition and by degrees came into almost general favor, so that now\n",
      "many an individual, who formerly had to battle with economical cares,\n",
      "finds himself in the possession of a little property and rejoices in his\n",
      "wellregulated family affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is likewise a special fund for sickness.\n",
      "\n",
      "A library has also been founded by the master of the manufactory,\n",
      "accessible both to the workman and his family and well used by them, at\n",
      "the same time too an infant school was started for the children of the\n",
      "work people. He likewise originated and supported with his own means the\n",
      "erection of a new schoolhouse, and embraced every opportunity of\n",
      "advancing the education therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "The social life of the workmen was also taken into consideration and the\n",
      "taste for more elevating amusements, invigorating alike to soul and\n",
      "body, encouraged. Of an evening they would meet in two singing societies\n",
      "to indulge in the good German song, or on Sundays they would amuse\n",
      "themselves with the crossbow in the free, fresh air of God’s Nature in\n",
      "the neighbouring forest, or again on festive occasions they would all\n",
      "meet together like one large united family for a sociable convivial\n",
      "repast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, care was also taken that the workman should mix with the world\n",
      "outside the factory, for which purpose a number of them were sent by the\n",
      "master of the factory to the Industrial Exhibition at Munich in order\n",
      "that they might themselves see the fruit of their labour publicly\n",
      "exposed to view and honorably mentioned, and at the same time obtain a\n",
      "glimpse of other branches of industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, in order to provide new dwellings for the workmen a large\n",
      "building was erected, of pleasing external proportions, and other\n",
      "buildings were converted into workmen’s dwellings. The houses themselves\n",
      "contain separate apartments, which afford the families at a low rent a\n",
      "much pleasanter abode than could be obtained in most of the houses in\n",
      "the towns. Nor is there any constraint; the houses are open to any body\n",
      "and the domestic regulations introduced in the interests of the\n",
      "community are of that nature, that they are cheerfully complied with by\n",
      "everyone. Thus there reigns in these premises a spirit of order and\n",
      "contentment, which alone can make life agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of _Stein_ did not formerly possess any church. For years\n",
      "all exertions to found a separate parish there remained fruitless, until\n",
      "at last the year 1861 brought their reward and in that year, in which\n",
      "the manufactory celebrated its hundredth anniversary, the peaceful clang\n",
      "of the bells for the first time invited the faithful to divine service\n",
      "in the newly erected church, the cost of which had been defrayed by the\n",
      "master of the factory entirely from his own means, out of concern for\n",
      "the spiritual welfare of his workpeople and attachment to his own native\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formerly neglected little village has assumed quite a different\n",
      "appearance since then. From afar the slender gothic steeple of the\n",
      "church may be seen rearing its pinnacle proudly aloft, while the smoke\n",
      "of the surrounding shafts tell of busy industry and labour. The former\n",
      "picture of want has given place to a certain degree of wealth and the\n",
      "little garden of the humble house been converted into two large parks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously however with this prosperity in general the manufactory\n",
      "had of course to experience some unpleasant incidents and obstinate\n",
      "struggles. The universal demand for _Faber’s_ manufactures was not slow\n",
      "in inducing other manufacturers to imitate and pirate the trademark of\n",
      "the manufactory, which is to be found on all articles manufactured\n",
      "there, and thus to pass off upon the public spurious goods possessing\n",
      "nothing more than the external similarity to the genuine articles, and\n",
      "which could scarcely aspire to mediocrity, which frauds were often\n",
      "repeated, coming to light in various countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manufacturing firm of Rubenstein at Moscow adopted the plan of\n",
      "making use of _Faber’s_ trademark and wrappers for their own\n",
      "manufactures and then to circulate them in the Russian market. These\n",
      "malpractises were carried on for a length of time in spite of every\n",
      "exertion to put a stop to them and the prohibition which the Russian\n",
      "Governement issued against the firm in question. Manufactures with\n",
      "spurious trademarks were constantly turning up in Russia until King\n",
      "_Maximilian_ of Bavaria during his protracted stay at Nürnberg in the\n",
      "year 1855 suppressed the evil. His lively interest for reviving industry\n",
      "had already induced him to decorate the proprietor of the manufactory\n",
      "with the order of merit of St. Michael, firstclass, in the year 1854, on\n",
      "which occasion he likewise honoured the factory at _Stein_ with a visit\n",
      "and made himself acquainted with all the details of its operations from\n",
      "the mouth of the manager of the factory, and as at that time these\n",
      "malpractises were brought before his notice he gave the matter all his\n",
      "attention and promised some assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor had we to wait long for this, for shortly afterwards _Lothar Faber_\n",
      "received a communication from the State ministry of the Royal House and\n",
      "Foreign affairs, stating, that, by the intervention of the Royal\n",
      "Bavarian Embassy at St. Petersburg, the evil had been put a stop to by\n",
      "the Russian Government; all the articles marked with _Faber’s_ trademark\n",
      "together with the stamp destroyed, and the manager of the Russian\n",
      "manufactory compelled to give assurance in writing that he would no\n",
      "longer pirate _Faber’s_ trademark, in default rendering himself liable\n",
      "to legal penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In New-York similar frauds were also carried on. Pencils manufactured in\n",
      "Nürnberg with _Faber’s_ trademark and in precise imitations of his\n",
      "wrappers were imported and sold by the firm of Winterhoff, Piper &\n",
      "C^{o.}. Complaint having been made, the Customhouse at New-York, at the\n",
      "instance of the examiner appointed for the department of “Literature,\n",
      "Writingmaterials and fine Arts”, detained one case of these spurious\n",
      "articles, whereupon the courts of law prohibited all further sale in the\n",
      "town and county of New-York.\n",
      "\n",
      "A still more cunning fraud was perpetrated at Nürnberg. A deaf and dumb\n",
      "lithographer by name Georg Wolfgang Faber was put forward, whose name\n",
      "was to be made use of. The similarity of the surname and wrapper exactly\n",
      "copied from those of _Faber’s_ manufactory were sufficient to make the\n",
      "public believe that they really had the genuine article from _Faber’s_\n",
      "manufactory before them. On the intervention of the authorities, whom\n",
      "_Lothar Faber_ put in motion, the reputed manufacturer was subjected to\n",
      "an examination, which proved him to be altogether incapable of producing\n",
      "such a thing as a serviceable article and shewed that he had only lent\n",
      "his name to other speculators, whereupon the Royal Government of middle\n",
      "Franconia withdrew the licence for pencil making from the said G. W.\n",
      "Faber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceedings were likewise taken against a Pencilmanufacturer at Fulda,\n",
      "who had manufactured and circulated upwards of seven thousand dozen\n",
      "leadpencils with the false stamp “A. W. Faber”. The Criminal Court of\n",
      "the Electorate of Hesse in a decision dated 2^{nd} September 1856,\n",
      "condemned the defendant, on account of fraud, to a pecuniary fine of 50\n",
      "Thalers and further to four weeks imprisonment, a decision, which the\n",
      "supreme Court of Appeal at Cassel absolutely confirmed. Similar events\n",
      "took place in other countries with like results.\n",

      "efforts to suppress every deception foisted upon the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meanwhile the manufactory assiduously endeavoured to attain to\n",
      "perfection in its products. As the stock of blacklead began to disappear\n",
      "in the mines of Cumberland, it succeeded, by its perfected manipulation\n",
      "of the material, in producing so many grades of hardness and supplying\n",

      "the lead. In addition to this they possess such an amount of softness\n",

      "several other improvements relating to their external appearance, the\n",
      "most useful and ornamental shapes for pencils of the finer descriptions\n",
      "were devised and introduced, and still more recently the socalled\n",
      "“_Artist’s pencils_” were added to the list of novelties and immediately\n",
      "met with the most universal recognition, which soon stimulated other\n",

      "that, which the English had so long sought for and which the perfected\n",
      "system of manufacture still stood much in need of in order to yield more\n",
      "than was previously possible, had been found. A new blacklead mine had\n",
      "been discovered. _Johann Peter Alibert_, merchant of the first class at\n",
      "Tabasthus in Siberia, had undertaken an exploring expedition in the\n",
      "mountainous eastern portion of Siberia, partly to search for gold. He\n",
      "examined the sand of the rivers Oka, Belloi, Kitoi and Irkutsk, and in\n",
      "one of the mountain ravines in the vicinity of Irkutsk lighted\n",
      "accidentally upon specimens of pure blacklead. _Alibert_ immediately\n",
      "recognised the value and importance of the material and instituted\n",
      "strict investigations until in the year 1847 after much labor and\n",
      "exertion he arrived at the conviction that, in a branch of the mountain\n",
      "range of Saian among the heights of the Batougol mountains four hundred\n",
      "versts westward of the town of Irkutsk, close to the frontier of China,\n",
      "a primitive deposit of blacklead must exist. He addressed himself at\n",
      "once to the task of opening a mine in order to bring the costly material\n",
      "to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the blacklead met with proved to be no better than the refuse\n",
      "Cumberland blacklead, and upwards of three hundred tons of this quality\n",
      "had to be removed before a deposit of the best and purest blacklead was\n",
      "finally opened up. Pieces were soon obtained weighing as much as eighty\n",
      "pounds. The Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, before which body\n",
      "_Alibert_ laid his samples of blacklead for analysis, declared the same\n",
      "to consist of the same elements and possess the same properties and\n",
      "consequently to be of precisely the same nature as the Cumberland\n",
      "blacklead. _Alibert_ now proceeded to England where he visited the\n",
      "declining blacklead mines of Cumberland and convinced himself by\n",
      "personal observation of the exhaustion and decay of the same. He\n",
      "thereupon submitted his samples of blacklead to some of the most\n",
      "extensive English leadpencil manufactories for examination, who\n",
      "unanimously confirmed the verdict of the Academy at St. Petersburg,\n",
      "pronouncing the quality of the Siberian blacklead to be excellent and in\n",
      "no way inferior to the Cumberland lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had cost _Alibert_ eight years of unremitting labour and a capital of\n",
      "one million Francs when he beheld his enterprise crowned with this\n",
      "certainly unexpected success.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now turned his attention to rendering the newly discovered material\n",
      "available for the manufacture of pencils. Having convinced himself that\n",
      "_Faber’s_ manufactory was the most extensive in existence and that it\n",
      "circulated the largest amount of fine goods in the world, he applied to\n",
      "the same with a proposition for an agreement, by virtue of which his\n",
      "blacklead was to be taken solely and exclusively by that establishment\n",
      "for the manufacture of pencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm on the other hand, having thoroughly convinced themselves that\n",
      "the newly discovered blacklead was quite equal to the genuine and best\n",
      "Cumberland blacklead in quality, willingly entertained this proposition\n",
      "of _Alibert’s_, so that in the year 1856 a contract was entered into\n",
      "between the manufactory and _Alibert_ and sanctioned by the Russian\n",
      "Government, according to which all the blacklead, which comes from the\n",
      "Siberian mines is to be delivered to _A. W. Faber’s_ manufactory, and to\n",
      "no other establishment for the purposes of pencil manufacture, now and\n",
      "for all time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a mighty work which the restless energy of _Alibert_ had brought\n",
      "into execution in a land so difficult of access. On the summit of the\n",
      "mountain of Batougol, which now in the Russian maps of the country is\n",
      "designated by the name of “_Alibertsberg_” in honorable remembrance of\n",
      "the discoverer of the blacklead mine, _Alibert_ assembled all his\n",
      "working force and a little colony soon sprung up, which addressed itself\n",
      "zealously to the new mining operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The miners brought the blacklead to the surface in large blocks and the\n",
      "material thus obtained proclaimed at once, by its external purity and a\n",
      "beautiful silvery lustre, its excellent value and composition. The\n",
      "transport was attended with immense difficulties. The blocks of\n",
      "blacklead, carefully packed in wooden cases, had to traverse enormous\n",
      "tracts of country, across which not the least vestige of a road is to be\n",
      "found, upon the backs of reindeer to reach the nearest seaport, whence\n",
      "they were shipped to Europe, while other consignments of the blacklead\n",
      "were forwarded to the manufactory exclusively by land.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be conceived that _Alibert_ by this discovery drew even the\n",
      "attention of the Russian Government upon himself and was gratified by\n",
      "the kindest encouragement both on part of the Czar and the Governor of\n",
      "the province of Irkutsk, Count _Murawiew Amursky_. In the report\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ALL people who have more taste than money are as one in the conviction\n",
      "that people with less money than taste suffer more keenly day by day,\n",
      "week by week, year by year, than any other class of human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this kind of sufferer was Philip Somerton, a young man who had\n",
      "strayed from a far-western country town to New York to develop his\n",
      "individuality and make his fortune, but especially to enjoy the\n",
      "facilities which a great city offers (as every one knows, except the\n",
      "impecunious persons who have tried it) to all whose hearts hunger for\n",
      "whatever is beautiful, refining, and also enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To some extent Philip had succeeded, for he quickly adapted himself to\n",
      "his new surroundings; and as he was intelligent, industrious, and of\n",
      "good habits, he soon secured a clerkship which enabled him to pay for\n",
      "food, shelter, and clothing, and still have money enough for occasional\n",
      "books and music and theatre tickets, and to purchase a few articles\n",
      "of a class over which the art editor of Philip's favorite morning\n",
      "newspaper raved delightfully by the column. Several years later he\n",
      "was still more fortunate; for he met Grace Brymme, a handsome young\n",
      "woman who had quite as much intelligence and taste as he, and who,\n",
      "like Philip, had been reared in a country town. That in New York she\n",
      "was a saleswoman in a great shop called a \"department store\" was not\n",
      "in the least to her discredit; for she was an orphan, and poor, and\n",
      "with too much respect to allow herself to be supported by relatives as\n",
      "poor as she, or to be \"married off\" for the sole purpose of securing\n",
      "a home. When Philip declared his love and blamed himself for having\n",
      "formed so strong an attachment before he had become financially able\n",
      "to support a wife in the style to which his sweetheart's refinement\n",
      "and cleverness entitled her, the young woman, who was quite as deep in\n",
      "love as he, replied that in so large a city no one knew the affairs\n",
      "of inconspicuous people, so there was no reason why they should not\n",
      "marry, and she retain her business position and salary under the only\n",
      "name by which her employers and business associates would know her, and\n",
      "together they would earn a modest competence against the glorious by\n",
      "and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they married, and told only their relatives, none of whom was in New\n",
      "York, and out of business hours the couple occupied a small apartment\n",
      "and a large section of Paradise, and together they enjoyed plays and\n",
      "concerts and pictures and books and bric-à-brac as they had never\n",
      "imagined possible when they were single; and when there was nothing\n",
      "special in the outer world to hold their attention they enjoyed each\n",
      "other as only warm-hearted and adaptive married people can.\n",
      "\n",
      "But marriage has no end of unforeseen mysteries for people who really\n",
      "love each other, and some of these obtruded themselves unexpectedly\n",
      "upon Philip and Grace, and gave the young people some serious moments,\n",
      "hours, and days. At first these disturbers were repelled temporarily\n",
      "by gales of kisses and caresses, but afterwards Grace's warm brown eyes\n",
      "would look deeper than they habitually were, and Philip would feel as\n",
      "if he had lost the power of speech. It was merely that each wished to\n",
      "be more and do more for the sake of the other. Philip knew that Grace\n",
      "was the sweetest, handsomest, cleverest, noblest woman in the world,\n",
      "and that the world at large had the right to know it. Grace thought\n",
      "Philip competent to illumine any social circle, and to become a leader\n",
      "among men; but how was the world to know of it while he and she were\n",
      "compelled to remain buried alive in a city in which no one knew his\n",
      "next-door neighbor except by sight? In her native village deserving\n",
      "young men frequently became partners of their employers, but Philip\n",
      "assured her that in New York no such recognition could be expected. The\n",
      "best he could hope for was to retain his position, be slowly promoted,\n",
      "and some day rank with the highest clerks.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening Philip, who ordinarily reached home later than his wife,\n",
      "stood in the door of the apartment when Grace appeared. He quieted the\n",
      "young woman with a rapturous smile, and said, with much lover-like\n",
      "punctuation:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of our troubles are ended, dear girl. We can live as we wish,\n",
      "and buy everything we wish. To-night--at once, if you like--we can\n",
      "afford to tell the whole world that we are no longer a mere clerk and a\n",
      "saleswoman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace at once looked more radiant than her husband had ever seen her;\n",
      "she exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil! Tell me all about it! Quick!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will, my dear, if you'll loosen your arms--or one of them--for a\n",
      "moment, so that I can get my hand into my pocket. I've inherited old\n",
      "Uncle Jethro's property. I don't know how much it amounts to, but\n",
      "he was a well-to-do country merchant, and here's a single check, on\n",
      "account, for a thousand dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil!\" exclaimed Grace, placing her hands on her husband's face and\n",
      "pushing it gently backward, while her cheeks glowed, and her lips\n",
      "parted, and her eyes seemed to melt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That makes me far happier than I was,\" said Phil, \"though I didn't\n",
      "suppose that could be possible. Your face is outdoing itself. I didn't\n",
      "suppose money could make so great a difference in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tisn't the money,\" Grace replied slowly, \"and yet, I suppose it is.\n",
      "But we won't reason about it now. We can do what we most wish--tell the\n",

      "But do tell me all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Is that all it is?\" asked Phil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you silly dear; you know it isn't. But you've scarcely ever\n",
      "mentioned your uncle to me; now it appears that you must have been very\n",
      "dear to him. I can't understand it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't, eh? That's somewhat uncomplimentary to me. I suppose the truth\n",
      "is that Uncle Jethro couldn't think of any one else to leave his money\n",
      "to; for he was a widower and childless. My dear dead-and-gone father\n",
      "was his only brother, and he had no sisters, so I'm the only remaining\n",
      "male member of the family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what sort of man was he? Do tell me something about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I knew a lot of pleasant things to tell, but I know little\n",
      "of him except what I heard when I was a boy. Father, in whom\n",
      "family affection was very strong, loved him dearly, yet used to be\n",
      "greatly provoked by him at times; for uncle's only thought was of\n",
      "money--perhaps because he had nothing else to think of, and he wrote\n",
      "advice persistently, with the manner of an elder brother--a man whose\n",
      "advice should be taken as a command. When I started East I stopped\n",
      "off and tramped three miles across country to call on him, for the\n",
      "letter he wrote us when father died was a masterpiece of affection and\n",
      "appreciation. I had never seen him, and I'm ashamed to say, after what\n",
      "has just occurred, that after our first interview I had no desire to\n",
      "see him again. His greeting was fervent only in curiosity; he studied\n",
      "my face as if I were a possible customer who might not be entirely\n",
      "trustworthy. Then he made haste to tell me, with many details, that he\n",
      "was the principal merchant and business man in the county, where he\n",
      "had started thirty years before, with no capital but his muscles and\n",
      "wits. He intimated that if I cared to remain with him a few months on\n",
      "trial, and succeeded in impressing him favorably, I might in time earn\n",
      "an interest in his business; but I thought I had seen enough of country\n",
      "stores and country ways to last me for life; so I made the excuse\n",
      "that as my parents were dead and my sisters married, I felt justified\n",
      "in going to New York to continue my studies. When he asked me what I\n",
      "was studying, I was obliged to reply, 'Literature and art,' at which\n",
      "statement he sneered--I may say truthfully that he snorted--and at once\n",
      "became cooler than before; so I improved my first opportunity, between\n",
      "customers' visits, to say that it was time for me to be starting back\n",
      "to the railway station. In justice to myself, however, as well as\n",
      "to him, I could not start without telling him how greatly his letter\n",
      "about my father had affected me. For a moment he was silent: he looked\n",
      "thoughtful, and as tender, I suppose, as a burly, hard-natured man\n",
      "could look; then he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Your father was one of the very elect, but--'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quickly interrupted with, 'I'm not very religious, but I won't\n",
      "listen to a word of criticism of one of the elect--least of all, of my\n",
      "father. Good by, uncle.' He made haste to say that the only two men\n",
      "of the Somerton family shouldn't part in anger; and when he learned\n",
      "that I had walked three miles through the darkness and November mud,\n",
      "and intended to walk back to the station, he told a man who seemed\n",
      "to be his clerk,--Caleb Wright, evidently the man mentioned in this\n",
      "extraordinary letter,--to get out some sort of conveyance and drive me\n",
      "over. While Caleb was at the stables, my uncle questioned me closely as\n",
      "to my capital and business prospects. I was not going to be outdone in\n",
      "personal pride, so I replied that, except for some mining stocks which\n",
      "some one had imposed upon my father, and were down to two cents per\n",
      "share, I'd exactly what he had told me he began with,--muscle and wits.\n",
      "He saw that I had no overcoat,--boys and young men in our part of the\n",
      "country seldom had them,--so he pressed one upon me, and when I tried\n",
      "to decline it, he said, 'For my dead brother's sake,' which broke me\n",
      "down. When I reached the train, I found in the overcoat pockets some\n",
      "handkerchiefs, gloves, hosiery, neckwear, and several kinds of patent\n",
      "medicines, which evidently he thought trustworthy; there was also a\n",
      "portemonnaie containing a few small notes and some coin. I wrote,\n",
      "thanking him, as soon as I found employment; but he never answered\n",
      "my letter, so I was obliged to assume that he had repented of his\n",
      "generosity and wished no further communication with me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange! But the man--Caleb--who drove you to the station, and who\n",
      "seems to be a life pensioner on the estate, and is to be dependent upon\n",
      "us,--how did he impress you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I scarcely remember him, except as a small man with a small\n",
      "face, small beard, a small gentle voice, and pleasanter eyes than\n",
      "country clerks usually have. I remember that his manner seemed very\n",
      "kindly,--after my experience with my uncle's,--and he said a clever\n",
      "or quaint thing once in a while, as any other countryman might have\n",
      "done. For the rest, he is a Civil War veteran, and about forty years of\n",
      "age--perhaps less, for beards make men look older than they are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the town with the odd name--Claybanks?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw it only in the dark, which means I didn't see it at all. I\n",
      "believe 'tis the county town, and probably it doesn't differ much\n",
      "from other Western villages of a thousand or two people. 'Twill be a\n",
      "frightful change from New York, dear girl, for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will be there,\" replied Grace, with a look that quickly brought\n",
      "her husband's arms around her. \"And you will be prominent among men,\n",
      "instead of merely one man among a dozen in a great office. Every one\n",
      "will know my husband; he won't any longer go to and from business as\n",
      "unknown as any mere nobody, as you and most other men do in New York.\n",
      "'Tis simply ridiculous--'tis unnatural, and entirely wrong, that my\n",
      "husband's many clever, splendid qualities aren't known and put to their\n",
      "proper uses. You ought to be the manager of the firm you are with,\n",
      "instead of a mere clerk. I want other people to understand you, and\n",
      "admire you, just as I do, but no one is any one in this great crowded,\n",
      "lonely, dreadful city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, there!\" said Philip. \"Don't make me conceited. Besides, we've\n",
      "neglected that check for at least ten minutes. Let's have another look\n",
      "at it. A thousand dollars!--as much money as both of us have had to\n",
      "spend in a year, after paying our rent! A tenth part of it will be more\n",
      "than enough to take us and our belongings to Claybanks; with the other\n",
      "nine hundred we'll buy a lot of things with which to delight ourselves\n",
      "and astonish the natives,--silk dresses and other adornments for you,\n",
      "likewise a piano, to replace the one we have been hiring, and some\n",
      "pictures, and bric-à-brac, and we'll subscribe to a lot of magazines,\n",
      "and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But suppose,\" said Grace, \"that after reaching there you find the\n",
      "business difficult or unendurable, and wish to come back to New York?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never fear for me! I'm concerned only for you, dear girl. I know\n",
      "Western country places, having been brought up in one; I know the\n",
      "people, and among them you will take place at once as a queen. But\n",
      "queens are not always the most contented of creatures. Their subjects\n",
      "may not be--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my first and dearest subject remains happy,\" said Grace, \"I shall\n",
      "have no excuse for complaining.\"\n",

      "II--TAKING POSSESSION\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE ensuing week was a busy one for Philip and Grace; for to announce\n",
      "an unsuspected marriage and a coming departure at one and the same\n",
      "time to two sets of acquaintances is no ordinary task, even to two\n",
      "social nobodies in New York. Besides, Philip had lost no time in making\n",
      "the legal acknowledgment that was requisite to the cashing of his\n",
      "check, and in spending a portion of the proceeds. A short letter came\n",
      "from Caleb Wright, enclosing one almost equally short from the late\n",
      "Jethro Somerton, which assured Philip of Caleb's honesty and general\n",
      "trustworthiness, and that the business would not suffer for a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb is a far better and broader man than I,\" Philip's uncle had\n",
      "written, \"but he lacks force and push. I'm satisfied he can't help\n",
      "it. He is stronger than he looks, and younger too, but he was fool\n",
      "enough to take part in the Civil War, where he got a bullet that is\n",
      "still roaming about in him, besides a thorough malarial soaking that\n",
      "medicine can't cure. This often makes him dull; sometimes for weeks\n",
      "together. But he knows human nature through and through, and if I had\n",
      "a son to bring up, I'd rather give the job to Caleb than trust myself\n",
      "with it. He has done me a lot of good in some ways, and I feel indebted\n",
      "to him and want him to be well cared for as long as he lives. His\n",
      "salary is small, and he won't ask to have it increased; but sometimes\n",
      "he'll insist that you help him with some projects of his own, and I\n",
      "advise you to do it, for he will make your life miserable until you do,\n",
      "and the cost won't be great. I used to fight him and lose my temper\n",
      "over some of his hobbies, but now I wish I hadn't; 'twould have been\n",
      "cheaper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That,\" said Philip, after reading the passage to Grace, \"is about as\n",
      "tantalizing as if written for the purpose of teasing me, for there's\n",
      "not a shadow of hint as to the nature of Caleb's projects and hobbies.\n",
      "He may be experimenting in perpetual motion or at extracting sunshine\n",
      "from cucumbers. Still, as the man is honest and his freaks are not\n",
      "expensive, I don't see that I can suffer greatly. By the way, when\n",
      "I informed our firm that they would have to endure the withdrawal\n",
      "of my valuable services, and told them the reason, they were not a\n",
      "bit surprised; they said my uncle had written them several times,\n",
      "asking about my progress and character, and they had been unable to\n",
      "say anything to my discredit. They had been curious enough to make\n",
      "inquiries, from the commercial agencies, about the writer of the\n",
      "letters, and they took pleasure in informing me that Uncle Jethro's\n",
      "store, houses, farms, were estimated by good judges, at--guess how\n",
      "much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace wondered vaguely a moment or two before she replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aunt Eunice's cousin was the principal merchant in a town of two or\n",
      "three thousand people, and his estate, at his death, was--inventoried,\n",
      "I think was the word--at twelve thousand dollars. Is it as much as\n",
      "that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Multiply it by six, my dear, and you'll be within the mark, which is\n",
      "seventy-five thousand dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I repeat it, seventy-five thousand dollars, and that in a country\n",
      "where a family with a thousand a year can live on the fat of the\n",
      "land! Our firm declares that our fortune will be as much to us, out\n",
      "there, as half a million would be in New York. Doesn't that make your\n",
      "heart dance? I can give you horses and carriages, dress you in silks\n",
      "and laces, hire plenty of servants for you; in short, make you in\n",
      "appearance and luxury what you will be by nature, the finest lady in\n",
      "the county. Dear woman, the better I've learned to know you, the more\n",
      "guilty I've felt at having married you; for I saw plainly that you were\n",
      "fit to adorn any station in the world, instead of being the wife of a\n",
      "man so poor that you yourself had to work for wages to help us have a\n",
      "home. At times I've felt so mean about it that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace stopped further utterance on the subject by murmuring:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seventy-five thousand dollars! What shall we do with it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Enjoy it, dear girl; that's what we shall do. We've youth, health,\n",
      "taste, spirits, energy, and best of all, love. If all these qualities\n",
      "can't help us to enjoy money, I can't imagine what else can. Besides,\n",
      "Claybanks is bound to be a city in the course of a few years--so uncle\n",
      "said; and if he was right, we will be prepared to take the lead in\n",
      "society. 'Twon't be injudicious to have the largest, best-furnished\n",
      "house, and a full circle of desirable acquaintances, against the time\n",
      "when the sleepy village shall be transformed in a day, Western fashion,\n",
      "into a bustling city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The several days that followed were spent largely in longings to get\n",
      "away, and regrets at leaving New York's many new delights that were\n",
      "at last within reach; but finally Philip wrote Caleb Wright that he\n",
      "would arrive at Claybanks on a specified date, and asked that the best\n",
      "room in the best hotel be engaged for him. The couple reached the\n",
      "railway station at dawn of a dull December morning, and after an hour\n",
      "of effort, while Grace remained in the single room at the station and\n",
      "endeavored not to be nauseated by the mixed odors of stale tobacco,\n",
      "an overloaded stove, and a crate of live chickens awaiting shipment,\n",
      "Philip found a conveyance to take them to Claybanks. The unpaved road\n",
      "was very muddy, and the trees were bare, the farm-houses were few and\n",
      "unsightly. Philip was obliged to ask:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it shockingly dismal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this the road,\" Grace answered, \"over which you walked, at night,\n",
      "when you visited your uncle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The very same, I suppose, for there's never a choice of roads between\n",
      "two unimportant places.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I sha'n't complain,\" said Grace, nestling very close to her\n",
      "husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlook did not improve as the travellers came near to the village\n",
      "of Claybanks. Houses were more numerous, but most of them were very\n",
      "small, many were unpainted, and some were of rough logs. The fences,\n",
      "while exhibiting great variety of design, were almost uniform in\n",
      "shabbiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather a dismal picture, isn't it?\" asked Philip. \"It suggests a\n",
      "kalsominer's attempt to copy a Corot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm keeping my eyes closed,\" Grace replied. \"I'm going to defer being\n",
      "impressed by the town until a sunny day arrives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were to look about you now,\" said Philip, gloomily, \"you'd\n",
      "see the fag end of nothing--the jumping-off place of the world. How\n",
      "my uncle succeeded in living here--still stranger in making money\n",
      "here--passes my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The best room at the hotel proved to be quite clean, but as bare as a\n",
      "hotel chamber could be, and also very cold. Philip begged for one with\n",
      "a fire, but was told that all warmed rooms were already occupied by\n",
      "regular lodgers. Fortunately breakfast was being served. It consisted\n",
      "of fried pork, fried sausage, fried eggs, tough biscuits, butter of a\n",
      "flavor which the newest guests neither recalled nor approved, two kinds\n",
      "of pie, and coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If this is the best hotel Caleb could find for us, what can the worst\n",
      "be?\" whispered Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps we can find board in a private family,\" whispered Grace, in\n",
      "reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How early will Somerton's store be open?\" asked Philip of the\n",
      "landlord, who had also served as table-waiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's been open since daybreak, I reckon; it usually is,\" was the\n",
      "reply. \"I shouldn't wonder if you was the new boss, seein' you have the\n",
      "same name. Well, I'm glad to see you. I'm one of your customers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you very much. Is the store far from here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only two blocks up street. You'll find Caleb there. You know Caleb\n",
      "Wright?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; I've been here before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That so? Must have put up at the other hotel, then--or mebbe you\n",
      "stopped with your uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Er--yes, for the little while I was in town. I wish there was a warm\n",
      "room in which my wife could rest, while I go up to the store to see\n",
      "Caleb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what's the matter with the parlor? Come along; let me show you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip looked into the parlor; so did Grace, who quickly said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do let me go to the store with you. You know I always enjoy a walk\n",
      "after breakfast.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pretty soft walkin', ma'am,\" said the landlord, after eying Grace's\n",
      "daintily shod feet. \"Better let me borrow you my wife's gum shoes;\n",
      "she ain't likely to go out of the house to-day. You ought to have gum\n",
      "boots, though, if you're dead set on walkin' about in winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace thanked the landlord for his offer and advice, but hurried Phil\n",
      "out of the hotel, after which she said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was my first visit to a hotel of any kind. Do they improve on\n",
      "acquaintance? Oh, Phil! Don't look so like a thunder-cloud! What can\n",
      "the matter be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should have been thoughtful enough to come a day or two in advance,\n",
      "and found a proper home for you. I hope Caleb will know of one. Be\n",
      "careful!--the sidewalk is ending. Let me go first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two or three successive planks served as continuation of the sidewalk,\n",
      "and their ends did not quite join, but Philip skilfully piloted his\n",
      "wife along them. Beyond, in front of a residence, was a brick walk\n",
      "about two feet wide, after which was encountered soft mud for about\n",
      "fifty linear feet. Philip looked about for bits of board, stone,\n",
      "brick--anything with which to make solid footing at short intervals.\n",
      "But he could see nothing available; neither could he see any person out\n",
      "of doors, so in desperation he took Grace in his arms and carried her\n",
      "to a street-crossing, where to his delight he saw a broad stick of hewn\n",
      "timber embedded in the mud and extending from side to side. After this\n",
      "were some alternations of brick sidewalk, mud, and a short causeway\n",
      "of tan-bark, the latter ending at a substantial pavement in front of\n",
      "a store over which was a weatherbeaten sign bearing the name JETHRO\n",
      "SOMERTON.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The treasure-house of Her Majesty Grace I., Queen of Claybanks,\" said\n",
      "Philip. \"Shall we enter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Philip opened the door, a small man who was replenishing the stove\n",
      "looked around, dropped a stick of wood, wiped his hands on his coat,\n",
      "came forward, smiling pleasantly, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Somerton, I'm very glad to see you again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Mr. Wright. Let me make you acquainted with Mrs. Somerton.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb seemed not a bit appalled as he shook hands with Grace. He held\n",
      "her hand several seconds while he looked at her, and seemed to approve\n",
      "of what he saw; then he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your uncle told me of your marriage, and thought you'd been very\n",
      "unwise. I reckon he'd change his mind if he was here, though 'twas a\n",
      "hard one to change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace blushed slightly and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so, I'm sure. Have you had the entire work of the store since\n",
      "Uncle Jethro died?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle--Jethro! I don't believe he'd have died if he'd heard you say\n",
      "that! Well, yes, I've been alone here. Your husband wrote he'd be along\n",
      "pretty soon, an' as the roads was so soft that the farmers didn't come\n",
      "to town much, I didn't think it worth while to get extra help. Come\n",
      "into the back room, won't you? There's chairs there, an' a good fire\n",
      "too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are the farmers your principal customers?\" Grace asked, as she sank\n",
      "into a capacious wooden armchair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they're the most important ones. They take most time, too,\n",
      "though some of the women-folks in this town can use more time in\n",
      "spendin' a quarter an' makin' up their minds--principally the latter,\n",
      "than--well, I don't s'pose you can imagine how they wait, an' fuss, an'\n",
      "turn things over, an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed I can,\" said Grace; \"for once I was a country girl, and in\n",
      "New York I was a saleswoman in a store, and have waited on just such\n",
      "customers half an hour at a time without making a sale, though the\n",
      "store was one of the biggest in the city, and its prices were as low as\n",
      "any.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to know!\" exclaimed Caleb, whose eyes had opened wide while\n",
      "Grace talked. \"You?--a country gal?--an' a saleswoman? I wouldn't have\n",
      "thought it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not? Don't I look clever enough?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that ain't it, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some day, when you and Philip are real busy,\" suggested Grace,\n",
      "\"perhaps you'll let me help you behind the counter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Somerton is a great joker,\" explained Philip, as Caleb continued\n",
      "to look incredulous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I wasn't joking,\" said Grace. \"I'll really help in the store some\n",
      "day when--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When your husband lets you, you said,\" remarked Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" drawled Caleb, slowly regaining his customary expression, \"I\n",
      "shouldn't wonder if Mrs. Somerton's the kind that's let to do pretty\n",
      "much as she likes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip laughed, and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're a quick judge of human nature, Mr. Wright. But before we talk\n",
      "business I want some advice and assistance. We can't live at that\n",
      "hotel; for my wife would have to sit in a cold room all day, which\n",
      "isn't to be thought of. Can't you suggest a boarding place, in a\n",
      "private family?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Scarcely, I'm afraid,\" Caleb replied after a moment of thought. \"I\n",
      "don't b'lieve any families here ever took boarders, or would know\n",
      "how to do it to your likin'. What's the matter with your takin' your\n",
      "uncle's house an' livin' in it? It's plain, but comfortable, an' just\n",
      "as he left it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there a servant in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; there hasn't been since his wife died, an' _she_ wasn't\n",
      "what you city folks call a servant. 'Helper' is what you want to say\n",
      "in these parts. They're hard to get, too, an' if they're not treated\n",
      "same as if they was members of the family, they won't stay. About your\n",
      "uncle,--well, you see he took his meals at the hotel, an' done his own\n",
      "housework, which didn't amount to much except makin' his bed ev'ry\n",
      "mornin' an' makin' fire through the winter. S'pose you take a look at\n",
      "it, when you're good and ready. It's on the back of the store-lot, and\n",
      "the key is in the desk here. Your furniture an' things, that come by\n",
      "rail, I had put in the warehouse behind the store, not knowin' just\n",
      "what you'd want to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip and Grace looked at each other, and exchanged a few words about\n",
      "possible housekeeping. Caleb looked at both with great interest, and\n",
      "improved the first moment of silence to say:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An' she's--you've--been a shop-girl!\" Philip frowned slightly, and\n",
      "Caleb hastened to add, \"I ort to have said a saleswoman. But who would\n",
      "have thought it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb is a character,\" Grace said as soon as she and her husband left\n",
      "the store. \"I'm going to be very fond of him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well; do so. I'll promise not to be jealous. He's certainly\n",
      "hearty, and 'tis good for us that he's honest; for we and all we have\n",
      "are practically in his hands and will remain there until I get a grip\n",
      "on the business. But I do wish Uncle Jethro hadn't been so enragingly\n",
      "non-committal about the chap's peculiarities. I shall be on pins and\n",
      "needles until I know what the old gentleman was hinting at. Besides, he\n",
      "may have been entirely mistaken. A mind that could imagine that this\n",
      "out-of-the-world hole-in-the-ground must one day become a city could\n",
      "scarcely have been entirely trustworthy about anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III--INTRODUCED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE house in which the late Jethro Somerton had lived was a plain\n",
      "wooden structure, entered by a door opening directly into a room which\n",
      "had been used as a sitting room. Behind this was a kitchen, beside\n",
      "which was a bedroom, while in front, beside the sitting room, was a\n",
      "\"best room\" or parlor. There was a second floor, in which were four\n",
      "rooms, some of which had never been used. The ceilings throughout the\n",
      "house were so low that Philip, who was quite tall, could touch them\n",
      "with his finger-tips when he stood on tiptoe. The walls of the sitting\n",
      "room and parlor were hard-finished and white; all the other walls were\n",
      "rough and whitewashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is quite out of the question, as a home,\" said Philip. \"No hall,\n",
      "no--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not make believe that the sitting room is a square hall?\" Grace\n",
      "asked. \"They're the rage in the swell villages around New York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there's no bath room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can make one, on the upper floor, where we've rooms to spare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps; but 'tis very improbable that the town has a water service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then have a tank, fed from the roof or by a pump, as Aunt Eunice\n",
      "has in her cottage, smaller than this and in a town no larger than\n",
      "Claybanks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No furnace, of course, to warm the house, and--ugh!--I don't believe\n",
      "the town knows of the existence of coal, for both stoves at the store\n",
      "are fed with wood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So they were, and--oh, I see! Here are fireplaces in the\n",
      "sitting-room--or hall, I suppose I should say--and in the parlor! Think\n",
      "how unutterably we longed for the unattainable--that is, an open wood\n",
      "fire--in our little flat in the city!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, dear girl, a fireplace grows cold at night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite likely; but don't you suppose the principal merchant in town\n",
      "could economize on something so as to afford enough quilts and blankets\n",
      "to keep his family from freezing to death while they sleep?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You angel, you've all the brains of the family. Where did you learn so\n",
      "much about houses? And about what to do when you don't find what you\n",
      "want in them? And who taught you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose necessity taught me,\" Grace replied, with a laugh, \"and\n",
      "within the past few minutes, too. For, don't you see, we must live in\n",
      "this house. There seems to be no other place for us. And I suppose\n",
      "'tis instinct for women, rather than men, to see the possibilities of\n",
      "houses, for a woman has to spend most of her life indoors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she walked slowly toward the kitchen, where she contemplated the\n",
      "stove, two grease-spotted tables, and four fly-specked walls. Philip\n",
      "followed her, saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a den! Money must be spent here at once, and--oh, Grace! You're\n",
      "crying? Come here--quick! I never before saw tears in your eyes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you never shall again,\" Grace sobbed. \"I don't see what can be the\n",
      "matter with me; it must be the cold weather that has--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This forlorn barn of a house and this shabby, God-forsaken town have\n",
      "broken your heart!\" exclaimed Philip. \"I wish I too could cry. I assure\n",
      "you my heart has been in my boots, though I've tried hard to keep it\n",
      "in its proper place. Don't let's remain here another hour. I'll gladly\n",
      "abandon my inheritance to the benevolent societies. We'll hurry back to\n",
      "the city and let our things follow us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we can't, Phil, for we've burned our bridges behind us. We can\n",
      "take only such money as will get us back, and we would not be certain\n",
      "of employment on reaching the city. Besides, we told our acquaintances\n",
      "of our good fortune, but not of its conditions; if we go back, they\n",
      "will suspect you and pity me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're right--you're right!\" said Philip, from behind tightly closed\n",
      "jaws. \"Why hadn't I sense to get leave of absence for a week, and look\n",
      "at the gift before accepting it? Still, we're alive; we have the money,\n",
      "and the first and best use of it is to make you comfortable. I'll get\n",
      "Caleb to get me some men at once,--one of them to make fires, and the\n",
      "others to bring over and unpack our goods. In the meanwhile, you shall\n",
      "at least keep warm in the office of the store. You'll have only barrels\n",
      "of molasses and vinegar and bales of grain-sacks for company, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But my husband won't be farther away than the next room,\" Grace said,\n",
      "\"and the door between shall remain open.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Philip kissed the tears from her eyes, and Grace called herself an\n",
      "unreasonable baby, and Philip called himself an unpardonable donkey,\n",
      "and they returned together to the store, entering softly by the back\n",
      "door, so that Caleb should not see them and join them at once. But\n",
      "dingy though the back windows of the office were, Caleb, standing\n",
      "behind one of them, said to himself:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rubbin' her face with her handkerchief!--that means she's been cryin'.\n",
      "Well, I should think she would, if city houses are anythin' like the\n",
      "picture-papers make 'em out to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb retired to the store, where Phil joined him after a few moments,\n",
      "and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall live in the old house, Mr. Wright. My wife and I have been\n",
      "looking it over, and we see how it can be made very comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do, eh?\" Caleb replied; at the same time his face expressed so\n",
      "much astonishment that Philip laughed, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mustn't mistake us for a pair of city upstarts. My wife, as she\n",
      "told you, was a country girl; she went to New York only a few years\n",
      "ago, and 'twas only four years since I passed through here on my way to\n",
      "the city. We're strong enough and brave enough to take anything as we\n",
      "find it, if we can't make it better. That reminds me that the old house\n",
      "can be bettered in many ways. Is there a plumber in the town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir!\" replied Caleb, with emphasis, and a show of indignation such\n",
      "as might have been expected were he asked if Claybanks supported a\n",
      "gambling den. \"We've read about 'em, in the city papers, an' I reckon\n",
      "one of 'em would starve to death if he come out here, unless the boys\n",
      "run him out of town first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! I'm going to beg you to restrain the boys when I coax a plumber\n",
      "here from the nearest city, for a few days' work in the house. And\n",
      "I've another favor to ask; you know people here, and I don't, as yet.\n",
      "Won't you find me two or three men, this morning--at once--to unpack\n",
      "my things that came from the city, and put them into the house? When\n",
      "they're ready to move them, I wish you'd make some excuse to coax\n",
      "my wife out here, so that I can slip down to the house, without her\n",
      "knowledge, and prepare a surprise for her by placing all our belongings\n",
      "about as they were in our rooms in the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good for you! Good for you!\" exclaimed Caleb, rubbing his hands. \"If\n",
      "you're that kind o' man, I reckon you're deservin' of her. Most men's\n",
      "so busy with their own affairs, or so careless, that women comin' to a\n",
      "new country have a back-breakin' time of it, an' a heart-breakin' too.\n",
      "I dunno, though, that I can keep her away from you long enough. From\n",
      "her ways,--the little I've seen of 'em,--I reckon she's one o' the kind\n",
      "o' wives that sticks to her husband like hot tar to a sheep's wool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you'll have no trouble, for she already has taken a great liking\n",
      "to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I recippercate the sentiment,\" said Caleb, again rubbing his hands.\n",
      "\"I don't know much, but a man can't work in a country store about\n",
      "twenty year or more without sizin' up new specimens of human nature\n",
      "powerful quick, an' makin' mighty few mistakes at it. You'll find out\n",
      "how it is. All of a sudden, some day, a new settler, that you never\n",
      "saw before, 'll come in an' want to be trusted for goods--sca'cely any\n",
      "of 'em has any cash, an' you have to wait for your pay till they can\n",
      "raise some kind of produce, an' bring it in. If you can't read faces,\n",
      "you're likely to be a goner, to the amount of what you sell, an' if\n",
      "you refuse, you may be a thousan' times wuss a goner; for if the man's\n",
      "honest, an' also as proud as poor folks usually be, he'll never forgive\n",
      "you, and some other storekeeper'll get all his trade. Or, a stranger\n",
      "passin' through town wants to sell a hoss; you don't know him or the\n",
      "hoss either, or whether they come by each other honestly, an'--But this\n",
      "ain't what you was talkin' about. I'll stir about and see what help I\n",
      "can pick up. I reckon you won't have no trouble in the store while I'm\n",
      "gone; prices is marked on pretty much everythin'. Want to get settled\n",
      "to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reckon I'll see to makin' fires in the house, then, so's to warm\n",
      "things up. If any customer comes in that you don't quite understand,\n",
      "or wants any goods that bothers you, try to hold him till I get back.\n",
      "'Twon't be hard. Folks in these parts ain't generally in a drivin'\n",
      "hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. I used to lounge in the stores in our town; I know their\n",
      "ways pretty well, and I remember many prices.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's good. Well, if you get stuck, get your wife to help you.\n",
      "There's a good deal in havin' been behind a counter, besides what Mrs.\n",
      "Somerton is of her own self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Caleb turned up his coat-collar and sauntered out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grace,\" shouted Philip, as soon as the door had closed, \"do come\n",
      "here! Allow me to congratulate you on having made a conquest of Caleb\n",
      "Wright. He kindly tolerates me, but 'tis quite plain that he regards\n",
      "you as the head of the family. I was going to replace that shabby old\n",
      "sign over the door, but now I fear that Caleb will demand that the new\n",
      "one shall read 'Mrs. Somerton & Husband.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace's face glowed as merrily as if it had not been tear-stained half\n",
      "an hour before, and she replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've not seen a possible conquest--since I was married--that would\n",
      "give me greater pleasure; for I am you, you know, and you are me, and\n",
      "the you-I would be dreadfully helpless if we hadn't such a man to\n",
      "depend upon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'You-I'! That's a good word--a very good one. You ought to be richly\n",
      "paid for coining it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pay me, then, and promptly!\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some forms of payment consume much time when the circumstances do\n",
      "not require haste: they also have a way of making the payer and\n",
      "payee oblivious to their surroundings, so Philip and Grace supposed\n",
      "themselves alone until they heard the front door close with a loud\n",
      "report, and saw a small boy who seemed to consist entirely of eyes.\n",
      "Grace quickly and intently studied the label of an empty powder keg on\n",
      "the counter, while Philip said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, young man. What can we do for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wantapoundo'shinglenails,\" was the reply, in nasal monotone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip searched the hardware section of the store, at the same time\n",
      "searching his memory for the price, in his native town, of shingle\n",
      "nails. The packing of the nails, in soft brown paper, was a slow and\n",
      "painful proceeding to a man whose hands in years had encountered\n",
      "nothing harder or rougher than a pen-holder, but when it was completed,\n",
      "the boy, taking the package, departed rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He forgot to pay for them,\" said Grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Philip replied. \"I hope his memory will be equally dormant in\n",
      "other respects.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it wasn't; for little Scrapsey Green stopped several times, on the\n",
      "way home, to tell acquaintances that \"up to Somerton's store ther\n",
      "was a man a-kissin' a woman like all-possessed, an' he wasn't Caleb,\n",
      "neither.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The aforesaid acquaintances made haste to spread the story abroad,\n",
      "as did Scrapsey's own family; so when Caleb returned, an hour later,\n",
      "the store was jammed with apparent customers, and Philip was behind\n",
      "one counter, and Grace behind the other, and the counters themselves\n",
      "were strewn and covered with goods of all sorts, at which the people\n",
      "pretended to look, while they gazed at the \"man and woman\" of whom they\n",
      "had been told.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must be kind o' tuckered out,\" said Caleb, softly, behind Grace's\n",
      "counter, as he stood an instant with his back to the crowd, and\n",
      "pretended to adjust a shelf of calicoes. \"Better take a rest in the\n",
      "back room. I'll relieve you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace responded quickly to the suggestion, while Caleb, leaning over\n",
      "the goods on the counter, said, again softly, to the women nearest\n",
      "him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the new Mr. Somerton's wife--an' that's him, at t'other\n",
      "counter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mighty scrumptious gal!\" commented a middle-aged woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, an' she's just as nice as she looks. Clear gold an' clear grit,\n",
      "an' her husband's right good stuff, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within two or three minutes Caleb succeeded in signalling Philip to the\n",
      "back room; five minutes later the store was empty, and Caleb joined the\n",
      "couple, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sell much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a penny's worth,\" Grace replied, laughing heartily. \"We've been\n",
      "comparing notes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sho!\" exclaimed Caleb, although his eyes twinkled. \"I met Scrapsey\n",
      "Green up the road, with a pound of shingle-nails that he said come\n",
      "from here, an' I didn't s'pose Scrapsey would lie, for he's one o' my\n",
      "Sunday-school scholars.\" Philip and Grace quickly reddened, while Caleb\n",
      "continued, \"Well, might's well be interduced to the gen'ral public\n",
      "one time's another, I s'pose, 'specially if you can be kept busy,\n",
      "so's not to feel uncomfortable. Besides,\" he said, after a moment of\n",
      "reflection, \"if a man hain't got a right to kiss his own wife, on his\n",
      "own property, whose wife has he got a right to kiss, an' where'bouts?\"\n",
      "Then Caleb looked at the account books on the desk, and continued:\n",
      "\"Reckon you forgot to charge the nails. Well, I don't wonder.\"\n",

      "IV--HOME-MAKING\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I WISH the Doctor would stop in,\" said Caleb, in a manner as casual as\n",
      "if his first call that morning had not been on Doctor and Mrs. Taggess,\n",
      "whom he told of the new arrivals, declaring that Philip and Grace were\n",
      "\"about as nice as the best, 'specially her, an' powerful in need of a\n",
      "cheerin' up,\" and begging Mrs. Taggess to invite Grace to midday dinner\n",
      "at once, so that Philip might be free to prepare his surprise for Grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Doctor?\" Grace echoed. \"Why, Mr. Wright, which of us looks ill?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither one nor t'other, at present,\" Caleb replied; \"but this\n",
      "country's full of malary, an' forewarned is forearmed. Besides, our\n",
      "doctor's the kind to do your heart good, an' his wife's just like him.\n",
      "They're good an' clever, an' hearty, an' sociable, an' up to snuff in\n",
      "gen'ral. Fact is, they're the salt of the earth, or to as much of it\n",
      "as knows 'em. Sometimes I think that Claybanks an' the round-about\n",
      "country would kind o' decay an' disappear if it wasn't for Doc Taggess\n",
      "an' his wife. Doc's had good chances to go to the city, for he's done\n",
      "some great cures that's got in the medical papers, but here he stays.\n",
      "He don't charge high, an' a good deal of the time it don't do him no\n",
      "good to charge, but here he sticks--says he knows all the people an'\n",
      "their constitutions, an' so on, an' a new doctor might let some folks\n",
      "die while he was learnin' the ropes, so to speak. How's that for a\n",
      "genuine man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"First-rate,\" said Philip, and Grace assented. Caleb continued to tell\n",
      "of the Doctor's good qualities, and suddenly said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak of angels, an' you hear their buggy-wheels, an' the driver\n",
      "hollerin' 'Whoa!' I think I just heard the Doctor say it, out in front.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A middle-aged couple bustled into the store; Grace hastily consulted a\n",
      "small mirror in the back room, and Caleb whispered to Philip:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they ask you folks to ride or do anythin', let your wife go, an'\n",
      "you make an excuse to stay. There's a powerful lot of your New York\n",
      "stuff to be fixed, if you expect to do it to-day. Come along! Doctor\n",
      "an' Mrs. Taggess, this is my new boss, an' here comes his wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Glad to meet you,\" said the Doctor, a man of large, rugged, earnest\n",
      "face, extending a hand to each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Taggess, who was a motherly-looking woman, exclaimed to Grace:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You poor child, how lonesome you must feel! So far from your home!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,--only the length of the store-yard,\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh? Brave girl!\" said the Doctor. \"That's the sort of spirit to have\n",
      "in a new country, if you want to be happy. Well, I can't stop more\n",
      "than a minute,--I've a patient to see in the back street. I understand\n",
      "you're stopping at the hotel, and as, for the reputation of the town,\n",
      "we shouldn't like you to get a violent attack of indigestion the first\n",
      "day, we came down to ask you to dine with us at twelve. Mrs. Somerton\n",
      "can ride up now and visit with my wife, and her husband can come up\n",
      "when he will. Caleb can give him the direction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So kind of you!\" murmured Grace, and Philip said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be under everlasting obligations to you for giving my wife a\n",
      "view of some better interior than that of a store or that dismal hotel,\n",
      "but I daren't leave to-day. Caleb has arranged for several men to see\n",
      "me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, I'll catch you some other day,\" said the Doctor. \"I must\n",
      "be going; hope you'll find business as brisk as I do. You may be sure\n",
      "that Mrs. Taggess will take good care of your wife, and see that she\n",
      "gets safely back. Good day. I'll drop in once in a while. Hope to know\n",
      "you better. I make no charge for social calls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it came to pass that within ten minutes Philip was furnishing his\n",
      "new home with the contents of the old. The possible contents of a New\n",
      "York flat for two are small, at best; yet as each bit of furniture,\n",
      "upholstery, and bric-à-brac was placed in position in the Jethro\n",
      "Somerton house, the plain rooms looked less bare, so Philip was\n",
      "correspondingly elated. True, he had to use ordinary iron nails to\n",
      "hang his pictures, and was in desperation for some moments for lack\n",
      "of rods for portières and curtains, but he supplied their places with\n",
      "rake-handles from the store and rested them in meat-hooks. He worked\n",
      "so long, and hurried so often into the store for one makeshift after\n",
      "another, that Caleb became excited and peered through the windows of\n",
      "the store's back room at his first opportunity, just in time to see the\n",
      "upright piano moved in. Unable to endure the strain of curiosity any\n",
      "longer, he quickly devised an excuse, in the shape of a cup of coffee\n",
      "and some buttered toast, all made at the stove in the back room of the\n",
      "store. Coaxing a trustworthy but lounging customer to \"mind store\" for\n",
      "him a minute or two, Caleb put the refreshments in a covered box and\n",
      "timed himself to meet Philip as the latter emerged from the warehouse\n",
      "with an armful of books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't want to disturb you, but seein' that you let the hotel\n",
      "dinner-hour pass an' was workin' hard, I thought mebbe a little snack\"\n",
      "(here Caleb lifted the lid of the box) \"'d find its way to the right\n",
      "place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wright, you're a trump! Would you mind bringing it into the house\n",
      "for me, my hands being full?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't want to intrude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense! Aren't we friends? If not, we're going to be. Besides, I\n",
      "really want some one to rejoice with me over the surprise I'm going to\n",
      "give my wife. Come right in. Drop the box on this table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" exclaimed Caleb, after a long suspiration, \"I reckon I done\n",
      "that just in time! A second more, an' I'd ha' dropped the hull thing\n",
      "on this carpet--or is it a shawl? Why, 'taint the same place at all!\n",
      "Je-ru-salem! What would your Uncle Jethro say if he could look in a\n",
      "minute? Reckon he'd want to come back an' stay. I dunno's I ought to\n",
      "have said that, though, for I've always b'lieved he was among the\n",
      "saved, an' of course your house ain't better'n heaven, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But 'twill be heaven to my wife and me,\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I reckon homes was invented 'specially to prepare folks for\n",
      "heaven,--or t'other place, 'cordin' to the folks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come into the parlor,\" said Philip, toast and coffee in hand. For a\n",
      "moment or two Caleb stood speechless in the doorway; then he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je-ru-salem! This reminds me to take off my hat. Why, I s'posed you\n",
      "folks wasn't over-an'-above well fixed in the city, but this is a\n",
      "palace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite,\" said Philip, although delighted by Caleb's comments.\n",
      "\"Thousands of quiet young couples in New York have prettier parlors\n",
      "than this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to know!\" Then Caleb sighed. \"I reckon that's why young people\n",
      "that go there from the country never come home again. I've knowed a\n",
      "lot of 'em that I'd like to see once more. Hello! I reckon that's a\n",
      "pianner; I've seen pictures of 'em in advertisements. A firm in the\n",
      "city once wanted your uncle to take the county agency for pianners.\"\n",
      "Caleb laughed almost convulsively as he continued, \"Ye ort to have seen\n",
      "Jethro's face when he read that letter!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say that there are no pianos in this county?\" asked\n",
      "Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just do. But there once was an organ. Squire Pease, out in Hick'ry\n",
      "Township, bought one two or three years ago for his gals. He was\n",
      "runnin' for sheriff then, an' thought somethin' so new an' startlin'\n",
      "might look like a sign of public spirit, an' draw him some votes. But\n",
      "somehow his gals didn't get the hang of it, an' the noises it made\n",
      "always set visitors' dogs to howlin', an' to tryin' to get into the\n",
      "house an' kill the varmint, whatever it was, an' Pease's dogs tried to\n",
      "down the visitors' dogs, an' that made bad feelin'; so Pease traded the\n",
      "organ to a pedler for a patent corn-planter, an' he didn't get 'lected\n",
      "sheriff, either. I allers reckoned that ef anybody'd knowed how to play\n",
      "on it, that organ might ha' been a means of grace in these parts, for\n",
      "I've knowed a nigger's fiddle to stop a drunken fight that was too much\n",
      "for the sheriff an' his posse.\" Caleb looked the piano over as if it\n",
      "were a horse on sale, and continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't seem to work with a crank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" replied Philip, placing a chair in front of the instrument\n",
      "and seating himself. \"This is the method.\" He indulged in two or three\n",
      "\"runs,\" and then, with his heart on Grace, he dashed into the music\n",
      "dearest to him and his wife--perhaps because it was not played at their\n",
      "own very quiet marriage,--the Mendelssohn Wedding March.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je-ru-salem!\" exclaimed Caleb. \"That's a hair-lifter! What a blessin'\n",
      "such a machine must be to a man that knows the tunes!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rightly construing this remark as an indication that Caleb longed to\n",
      "hear music with which he was acquainted, Philip searched his memory for\n",
      "familiar music of the days when he was a country boy, and which would\n",
      "therefore be recognized by Caleb. Suddenly he recalled an air very dear\n",
      "to several religious denominations, although it has been dropped from\n",
      "almost all modern hymnals, probably because its vivacity, repetitions,\n",
      "and its inevitable suggestion of runs and variations had made it\n",
      "seem absolutely indecorous to ears that were fastidious as well as\n",
      "religious. Philip had heard it played (by request) as a quick march, by\n",
      "a famous brass band, at the return of troops from a soldier's funeral\n",
      "in New York; so, after playing a few bars of it softly, he tried to\n",
      "recall and imitate the march effect. He succeeded so well that soon he\n",
      "was surprised to see Caleb himself, an ex-soldier, striding to and fro,\n",
      "singing the hymn beginning:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Am I a soldier of the Cross?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Philip stopped, Caleb shouted:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three cheers for the gospel! Say! I wish--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" replied Caleb. \"I was only thinkin' that if our church\n",
      "could hear that, there'd be an almighty revival of religion. Reckon I'd\n",
      "better git back to the store. Say, you've been so full of palace-makin'\n",
      "that you've let the fires go out. I'll just load 'em up again for you;\n",
      "afterwards, if you chance to think of 'em, there's lots of good dry\n",
      "hick'ry in the woodshed, right behind the kitchen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip continued to make hurried dashes into the store for necessities\n",
      "and makeshifts. When finally he entered for candles, Caleb remarked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll call you in when your wife comes; but if you don't want her to\n",
      "smell a rat, you'd better shut the front shutters. There's already\n",
      "been people hangin' on the fence, lookin' at them lace fixin's in\n",
      "the winders, an' women are powerful observin'. An' say, here's a new\n",
      "tea-kettle, full of water; better set it on the kitchen stove. Pianners\n",
      "are splendid,--I never would have believed there could be anythin' like\n",
      "'em,--but the singin' of a tea-kettle's got a powerful grip on most\n",
      "women's ears. I didn't see no ev'ryday dishes among your things. Don't\n",
      "you want some?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip thought he did not, and he hurried to the house. He was soon\n",
      "summoned to the store, and through the coming darkness of the sunset\n",
      "hour he saw at the back door his wife, who said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil! Mrs. Taggess is the dearest woman! We were of the same age\n",
      "before I'd been with her an hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh? You don't look a moment older.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But she looked twenty years younger. When she's animated, she--oh, I\n",
      "never saw such a complexion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not even in your mirror?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you silly dear! And her home is real cosey. There's nothing showy\n",
      "or expensive in it; but if ever I get homesick, I'm going to hurry up\n",
      "there, even if the mud is a foot deep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good! Perhaps you got some ideas of how to fix up our own dismal barn\n",
      "of a house. Come down and look about it once more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Together they started. As they reached the front door, and Philip threw\n",
      "it open, Caleb, with his eye at the back window of the store, saw Grace\n",
      "stop and toss up her hands. As the door closed, Caleb jumped up and\n",
      "down, and afterward said to himself:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are times when I wish, church or no church, that I'd learned how\n",
      "to dance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil! Phil! Phil!\" exclaimed Grace, dashing from one room to another,\n",
      "all of which were as well lighted as candles could make them. \"How\n",
      "did you?--how could you? No woman could have done better! Oh!\n",
      "home!--home!--home! And a few hours ago, right here, I was the most\n",
      "disheartened, rebellious, wicked woman in the world! Come here to\n",
      "me--this instant!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are times when manly obedience is a natural virtue. For a few\n",
      "moments a single easy chair was large enough for the couple, who\n",
      "laughed, and cried, and otherwise comported themselves very much as\n",
      "any other healthy and affectionate couple might have done in similar\n",
      "circumstances. A knock at the door recalled them to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't like to disturb you,\" said Caleb, \"but Doc Taggess has dropped\n",
      "in again an' asked for Mr. Somerton, an' as his time's not all his own,\n",
      "mebbe you'd--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do tell him how I enjoyed my day with his wife,\" said Grace. \"I tried\n",
      "to, when he brought me down, but I don't feel that I said half enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip hurried to the store; Caleb lingered and said to Grace:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reckon you've had a little s'prise, hain't you? Your husband showed me\n",
      "'round a little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Little surprise? Oh, Mr. Wright! 'Twas the greatest, dearest surprise\n",
      "of my life. But 'twas just like Phil; he's the thoughtfullest, smartest\n",
      "man in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is, eh? Well, stick to that, an' you'll always be happy, even if you\n",
      "should chance to be mistaken. But say,--'what's sauce for the goose is\n",
      "sauce for the gander,' as I reckon you've heard. Don't you want to give\n",
      "your husband a pleasant s'prise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't I!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm kind o' feared to ask you, after seein' all these fine\n",
      "things; but you said you was brought up in the country. Can you cook?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I can! I've cooked all our meals at home since we were\n",
      "married--except those that Phil prepared.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good! Well, there's self-raisin' flour an' all sorts o' groceries in\n",
      "the store, an' eggs an' butter in the store cellar, an' alongside of\n",
      "the warehouse there's an ice-house, with three or four kinds o' meat.\n",
      "We have to take all sorts o' things in trade from country customers,\n",
      "an' some of 'em won't keep without ice. Now, if you was to s'prise your\n",
      "husband with a home-made supper, he wouldn't have to go down to the\n",
      "hotel, an' mebbe your own heart wouldn't break not to have to eat down\n",
      "there again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Wright! You're a genius! I wonder whether I could manage the\n",
      "kitchen stove.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Best way to find out's to take a look at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace followed the suggestion. Caleb explained the draught and dampers,\n",
      "and took Grace's orders, saying, as he departed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doc'll keep him in the store till I get back,--that's what he's there\n",
      "for,--an' I'll keep him afterwards. When you want him, pull this rope:\n",
      "it starts an alarm in my room, over the store, an' I'll hear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Taggess gave Philip some health counsel, at great length.\n",
      "Claybanks and the surrounding country was very malarious, he said, and\n",
      "newcomers, especially healthy young people from the East, could not\n",
      "be too careful about diet, dress, and general habits until entirely\n",
      "acclimatized. Then he got upon some of his hobbies, and Philip thought\n",
      "the conversation might be very entertaining if Grace and the new home\n",
      "were not within a moment's walk. No sooner had the Doctor departed than\n",
      "Caleb insisted on a decision regarding an account that was in dispute,\n",
      "because the debtor was likely to come in at any moment, and the matter\n",
      "was very important. He talked details until Philip was almost crazed\n",
      "with impatience, but suddenly a muffled whir caused Caleb to say\n",
      "abruptly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's better for him to suffer than for your wife to do it; an' if\n",
      "you don't be ready to start her for supper the minute the hotel bell\n",
      "rings, you won't get the best pickin's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip escaped with great joy, and a minute later was in his new\n",
      "sitting room and staring in amazement at a neatly set table, with Grace\n",
      "at the head of it, and upon it an omelette, a filet of beef, some crisp\n",
      "fried potatoes, tea-biscuits, cake, and a pot of coffee. After seating\n",
      "himself and bowing his head a moment, he succeeded in saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'How did you?--how could you?' as you said to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could I help it,\" Grace replied, \"after the delicate hint you left\n",
      "behind you,--the kettle boiling on the stove?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear girl, like little George Washington, I cannot tell a lie.\n",
      "Caleb was responsible for that tea-kettle; he brought it from the\n",
      "store, and said something poetical about the singing of a kettle being\n",
      "music to a woman's ear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb did that?\" exclaimed Grace, springing from her chair. \"Set\n",
      "another place, please!\" Then she dashed through the darkness, into the\n",
      "store, and exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Wright, I shan't eat a single mouthful until you come down and\n",
      "join us. Lock the store--quick--before things get cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your word's law, I s'pose,\" said Caleb, locking the front door, \"but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'But me no buts,'\" Grace said, taking his hand and making a true \"home\n",
      "run.\" Caleb seated himself awkwardly, looked around him, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hope you asked a blessin' on all this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never ate a meal without one,\" Philip replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reckon you'll get along, then,\" said Caleb, looking relieved and\n",
      "engulfing half of a tea-biscuit.\n",

      "malarial soaking, mentioned in Uncle Jethro's letter, had reached the\n",
      "point of saturation, or that the Confederate bullet had found a new\n",

      "But Caleb was not conscious of anything out of the usual--except the\n",

      "that in New York Philip and his wife had bathed daily. Afterward he\n",
      "talked bathing with the occasional commercial travellers who reached\n",
      "Claybanks--men who seemed \"well set up,\" despite some distinct signs of\n",
      "bad habits, and learned that men of affairs in the great city thought\n",
      "bathing quite as necessary as eating. He talked to Doctor Taggess on\n",
      "the subject, and was told in reply that, in the Doctor's opinion,\n",
      "cleanliness was not only next to godliness, but frequently an absolute\n",

      "etc., has cost? The bill amounts to about a hundred and fifty dollars,\n",
      "and it can't be charged to my account for six months, like most of our\n",
      "purchases for the store.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That so?\" drawled Caleb, carelessly, though in his heart he was\n",
      "delighted; for Philip had also engaged from the city a paper-hanger,\n",
      "and he had employed a local painter to do a lot of work; and Caleb, who\n",
      "knew the business ways of country stores, had trembled for the bills,\n",
      "yet doubted his right to speak of them. \"Well, have you got the money\n",
      "to pay for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but not much more; and in the two weeks I've been here the store\n",
      "has taken in about forty dollars in cash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's about it, I b'lieve. Well, realizin'-time is comin'; it's\n",
      "right at hand, in fact, an' I've wanted a chance to have a good long\n",

      "'cause his wife was more'n ordinary good-lookin', an' liked to show\n",

      "for it, I'll make you a present of it, an' you can lay all the blame on\n",

      "Your uncle said, 'All right,' an' got off a line from an advertisement\n",

      "in the room, with the clothes, an' a white shirt with cuffs an' collar\n",
      "on it, an' told him to lock himself in an' go to work, an' to pound\n",
      "on the door if he got into trouble. In about ten minutes he pounded,\n",

      "somethin' to put in the plate in church on Sunday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there are rentals due from several farms, and from houses in\n",
      "town. Are they as hard to collect as interest on mortgages?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, no--oh, no. The rent of most of the farms is payable in produce;\n",
      "there's ironclad written agreements, recorded in the county clerk's\n",
      "office, that the renters shan't sell any of their main crops anywhere\n",
      "else until the year's rent is satisfied. One of 'em pays by clearin'\n",
      "five acre of woodland ev'ry winter, an' gettin' it under cultivation in\n",
      "the spring, and another has to do a certain amount of ditchin' to drain\n",
      "swampy places. You'll have to watch them two fellers close, or they'll\n",
      "skimp their work, for there's nothin' farmers hate like clearin' an'\n",
      "ditchin'. I don't blame 'em, either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the houses in town?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, they're all right. The man in one of 'em, at two dollars a month,\n",
      "cuts all the firewood for the store an' house; that about balances his\n",
      "bill. Another house, at three thirty-three a month, has a cooper in\n",
      "it; he pays the rent, an' all of the stuff he buys at the store, in\n",
      "barrels for us in the pork-packin' season. The three an' a-half a month\n",
      "house man works out his rent in the pork-house durin' the winter, an'\n",
      "the four dollar house has your insurance agent in it; there's always a\n",
      "little balance in his favor ev'ry year. The--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb!\" exclaimed Philip, \"wait a minute; do you mean to tell me that\n",
      "houses in Claybanks rent as low as four dollars, three and a half,\n",
      "three and a third, and even as low as two dollars a month?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I said. Why, the highest rent ever paid in this town was\n",
      "six dollars a month. The owner tried to stick out for seventy-five\n",
      "a year, but the renter wouldn't stand the extra twenty-five cents a\n",
      "month.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip put his face in his hands, his elbows on his knees, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six dollars a month! And in New York I paid twenty-five dollars a\n",
      "month for five rooms, and thought myself lucky!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twenty--five--dollars--a month!\" echoed Caleb. \"Why, if it's a fair\n",
      "question, how much money did you make?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eighty dollars a month, with a certainty of a twenty per cent increase\n",
      "every year. 'Twasn't much, but I was sure of getting it. From what\n",
      "you've been telling me, I'm not absolutely sure of anything whatever\n",
      "here, unless I do a lot of special and peculiar work--and after I've\n",
      "earned the money by delivering the goods.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, your uncle averaged somethin' between three an' four thousan',\n",
      "clear, ev'ry year, an' he come by it honestly, too, but there's no\n",
      "denyin' that he had to work for it. From seven in the mornin' to nine\n",
      "at night in winter; five in the mornin' till sundown in summer, to say\n",
      "nothin' of watchin' the pork-house work till all hours of the night\n",
      "throughout the season--a matter o' two months. He always went to sleep\n",
      "in church Sunday mornin', but the minister didn't hold it agin him.\n",
      "That reminds me: your uncle was a class-leader, an' the brethren are\n",
      "quietly sizin' you up to see if you can take the job where he left off.\n",
      "I hope you'll fetch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Caleb,\" said Philip, closing his eyes as if to exclude\n",
      "the prospect. \"But tell me,\" he said a moment later, \"why my uncle\n",
      "did so much for so little. Don't imagine that I underrate three or\n",
      "four thousand dollars a year, but--money is worth only what it really\n",
      "brings or does. That's the common-sense view of the matter, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I can't see anythin' the matter with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But uncle got nothing for his money but ordinary food, clothes, and\n",
      "shelter, and seems to have worked as hard as any overworked laborer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I reckon he was doin' what the rest of us do in one way or\n",
      "other; he was countin' on what there might be in the future. He\n",
      "b'lieved in a good time comin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,--in heaven, perhaps, but not here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's where you're mistaken, for he did expect it here--right here,\n",
      "in Claybanks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip looked incredulous, and asked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he could remember when Chicago was as small as Claybanks is now,\n",
      "an' had a good deal more swamp land to the acre, too--an' now look at\n",
      "it! He'd seen St. Paul an' Minneapolis when both of 'em together could\n",
      "be hid in a town as big as Claybanks--but now look at 'em!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But St. Paul and Minneapolis had an immense water-fall and\n",
      "water-power to attract millers of many kinds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't we got a crick? They calculate that with a proper dam\n",
      "above town, we'd have water-power nine months every year, an' there\n",
      "ain't nothin' else o' the kind within fifty mile. Then there's our clay\n",
      "banks that the town was named after; they're the only banks of brick\n",
      "clay in the state; ev'rywhere else folks has to dig some feet down for\n",
      "clay to make bricks, so we ought to make brick cheaper'n any other\n",
      "town, an' supply all the country round--when we get a railroad to haul\n",
      "'em out. They're not as red as some, bein' really brown, but they're a\n",
      "mighty sight harder'n any red brick, so they're better for foundations\n",
      "an' for walls o' big buildings. Chicago didn't have no clay banks nor\n",
      "water-power, but just look at her now! All that made her was her bein'\n",
      "the first tradin' place in the neighborhood; well, so's Claybanks, an'\n",
      "it's been so for forty year or more, too, so its time must be almost\n",
      "come. Your uncle 'xpected to see it all in his time, but, like Moses,\n",
      "he died without the sight. Why, there's been three or four railroads\n",
      "surveyed right through here--yes, sir!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there any Western town that couldn't say as much, I wonder?\" Philip\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mebbe not, but they hain't all got clay banks an' a crick; not many of\n",
      "'em's got eleven hundred people in forty year, either. An' say--it's\n",
      "all right for you to talk this way with me--askin' questions an' so on,\n",
      "an' wonderin' if the place'll ever 'mount to anythin', but don't let\n",
      "out a bit of it to anybody else--not for a farm. You might's well be\n",
      "dead out here as not to believe in the West with all your might, an'\n",
      "most of all in this part of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you; I'll remember.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Philip went out and walked slowly about the shabby village until\n",
      "he found himself in the depths of the blues.\n",

      "VI--THE UNEXPECTED\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"THE nicer half of the You-I seems buried in contemplation this\n",
      "morning,\" said Philip at his breakfast table, the Saturday before\n",
      "Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The home-half of the You-I,\" Grace replied, after a quick rally from\n",
      "a fit of abstraction, \"was thinking that it saw very little of the\n",
      "store-half this week, except when she went to the store to look for it.\n",
      "Was business really so exacting, or was it merely absorbing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twas both, dear girl,\" said Philip, wishing he might repeat to her\n",
      "all that Caleb had said to him as recorded in the preceding chapter,\n",
      "and then scolding himself for the wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder,\" Grace said, \"whether you know you often look as if you were\n",
      "in serious trouble?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do I? I'm sorry you noticed it, but now that it's over, I don't object\n",
      "to telling you that if a single money package had arrived six hours\n",
      "later than it did, the principal general store of this county would\n",
      "have taken second or third place in the public esteem.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil! Was it so large a sum?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; merely two hundred dollars, but without it I would have had to\n",
      "decline to buy two or three wagon-loads of dressed hogs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Dressed hogs'! What an expression!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so; still, 'tis the meatiest one known in this part of the\n",
      "country. I can't say, however, that 'tis an ideal one for use when\n",
      "ladies are present, so I beg to move the previous question. What was\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twas that I've seen very little of you this week except when I've\n",
      "been to the store to look for you. Won't the business soon be easier,\n",
      "as you become accustomed to it, so we may have our evenings together\n",
      "once more?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so,\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You didn't say that as if you meant it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I? Well, dear girl, to-morrow will be Sunday, and you shall\n",
      "have every moment of my time, and 'I shall bathe my weary soul in seas\n",
      "of heavenly rest,' as Caleb frequently sings to himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You poor fellow! You need more help in the store, if you don't wish to\n",
      "become worn out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how any one could assist me. Caleb is everything he should\n",
      "be, but he has given me to understand that everything really depends\n",
      "upon the proprietor, and the more I learn of the business, the more\n",
      "plainly I see that he is right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace asked a few questions, and after Philip had answered them he\n",
      "exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You artful, inquisitive, dreadful woman! You've dragged out of me a\n",
      "lot of things that I'd determined you shouldn't know, for I've always\n",
      "had an utter contempt for men who inflict their personal troubles upon\n",
      "their wives. But you can imagine from what I've told you that no one\n",
      "but a partner could relieve me of any of my work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why not teach your partner the business?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twill be time to do that when I get one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be stupid, Phil,\" Grace said, rising from her chair, going to\n",
      "her husband, and bestowing a little pinch and a caress. \"Don't you know\n",
      "who I mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear girl,\" said Philip, \"you're quite as clever as I,--which is no\n",
      "compliment,--and everybody adores you. But the idea of your dickering\n",
      "by the hour with farmers and other countrymen--and dickering is simply\n",
      "the soul of our business--is simply ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see why,\" Grace replied, with a pout, followed by a flash in\n",
      "her deep brown eyes. \"Some of the farmers' wives 'dicker,' as you call\n",
      "it, quite as sharply as their husbands. Am I stupider than they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--no! What an idea! But--they've been brought up to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Which means merely that they've learned it. What women have done woman\n",
      "can do. I hope I'm not in the way in the store when you're talking\n",
      "business?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the way! You delicious hypocrite!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've listened a lot for business' sake, instead of merely for\n",
      "fun. Besides, I do get dreadfully lonesome in the house at times,\n",
      "in spite of a little work and a lot of play--at the piano. Oh, that\n",
      "reminds me of something. Prepare to be startled. A great revival effort\n",
      "is to begin at the church to-morrow night, and a committee of two,\n",
      "consisting of Caleb and Mr. Grateway, the minister, have been to me to\n",
      "know--guess what they wanted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! I shouldn't wonder if they wanted you to promise to sit beside\n",
      "the minister, so that all the susceptible young men might be coaxed to\n",
      "church and then shaken over the pit and dragged into the fold. Caleb\n",
      "and the minister have long heads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be ridiculous! What they ask is that you'll have our piano moved\n",
      "to the church, and that you'll play the music for the hymns. There's to\n",
      "be a lot of singing, and the church hasn't any instrumental music, you\n",
      "know, and Caleb has been greatly impressed by your playing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll be--I don't know what. Old fools! I wish they'd asked me\n",
      "direct! They'd have got a sharp, unmistakable 'NO!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So they said; that was the reason they came to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you said--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I'd consult you, and that if for any reason you felt that you\n",
      "must decline, I would play for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grace--Somerton!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't I? I often played the melodeon for the choir in our\n",
      "village church before I went to New York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you, indeed? But I might have imagined it, for there seems to be\n",
      "nothing that you can't do, or won't attempt. But let us see where we\n",
      "are. You've promised, practically, that they shall have the music; if\n",
      "I decline to play, they'll think I'm stuck up, or something of which,\n",
      "for business' sake, I can't afford to be suspected. Besides, when I\n",
      "married you I made some vows that weren't in the service, and one of\n",
      "them was that I never would shift any distasteful duty upon my wife. On\n",
      "the other hand, these Methodists are a literal lot of people. They've\n",
      "wanted me to become a class-leader because Uncle Jethro was one. I\n",
      "believe the duties are to inflict spiritual inquisition every Sunday\n",
      "upon specified people in the presence of one another. I escaped only\n",
      "by explaining that I was not a member of their denomination. But give\n",
      "them an inch and they'll take an ell. If I play for them that night,\n",
      "they'll expect me to do it the next, and again and again, probably\n",
      "every Sunday, and I certainly shan't have our piano jogged once a week\n",
      "over frozen roads, with the nearest tuner at a city seventy-five miles\n",
      "away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then let me tell them that you won't allow them to be disappointed,\n",
      "but that as you've not been accustomed to play for church singing, and\n",
      "I have, that I will play for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That means that every one in the church will stare at you, which\n",
      "will make your husband feel wretchedly uncomfortable. Aside from\n",
      "that, you'll distract attention from the minister; so although I know\n",
      "that you personally are a means of grace--Grace, itself, indeed, ha,\n",
      "ha!--the effect of the sermon won't be worth any more than a bag of\n",
      "corn-husks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil! don't imagine that everybody sees me through your eyes.\n",
      "Besides, except while playing I shall sit demurely on a front bench,\n",
      "with my back to the congregation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Caleb and the minister were rejoiced, and spread the announcement\n",
      "throughout the town, and Grace rehearsed the church's familiar airs to\n",
      "all the hymns on the list which the minister gave her, though some of\n",
      "them she had to learn by ear, by the assistance of Caleb, who whistled\n",
      "them to her. Soon after dark on Sunday night six stalwart sinners,\n",
      "carefully selected by Caleb, exulted in the honor of carrying the\n",
      "little upright piano to the church, where they remained so as to be\n",
      "sure of seats from which to hear the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Methodist church edifice in Claybanks could seat nearly three\n",
      "hundred people and give standing room to a hundred more. Seldom had\n",
      "it been filled to its extreme capacity; but when the opening hymn was\n",
      "\"given out\" on the night referred to, the building was crowded to\n",
      "the doors and a hundred or more persons outside begged and demanded\n",
      "that windows and doors should remain open during the singing. Pastor\n",
      "Grateway, who had been in the ministry long enough to make the most of\n",
      "every opportunity, improved this occasion to announce that according to\n",
      "custom in all churches possessing instruments, the music of each hymn\n",
      "would be played before the singing began. Grace, quite as uncomfortable\n",
      "as her husband would have been in her place, was nevertheless familiar\n",
      "with the music and the piano, and the congregation rose vociferously\n",
      "to the occasion. Even the sinners sang, and one back-seat ruffian, who\n",
      "had spent a winter in a city and frequented concert saloons, became so\n",
      "excited as to applaud at the end of the first hymn, for which he was\n",
      "promptly tossed through an open window by his more decorous comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hymn after the prayer was equally effective, so the minister\n",
      "interpolated still another one after the scripture reading called the\n",
      "\"second lesson.\" He, too, had been uplifted by the music--so much\n",
      "uplifted that he preached more earnestly than usual and also more\n",
      "rapidly, so as to reach the period of \"special effort.\" At the close of\n",
      "the sermon he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As we sing the hymn beginning 'Come, ye Sinners, Poor and Needy,' let\n",
      "all persons who wish to flee from the wrath to come, and desire the\n",
      "prayers of true believers, come forward and kneel at the mourners'\n",
      "bench.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The hymn was sung, and two or three persons approached the altar\n",
      "and dropped upon their knees. As the last verse was reached, Caleb\n",
      "whispered to the minister, who nodded affirmatively; then he whispered\n",
      "to Grace, who also nodded; then he found Philip, who was seated\n",
      "near the front, to be within supporting distance of his wife, and\n",
      "whispered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give your wife a spell for a minute; play 'Am I a Soldier of the\n",
      "Cross' the way you did the other day for me. That'll fetch 'em!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip frowned and refused, but Caleb snatched his hand in a vise-like\n",
      "grasp and fairly dragged him from his seat. Half angry, half defiant,\n",
      "yet full of the spirit of any man who finds himself \"in for it,\"\n",
      "whatever \"it\" may be, Philip dropped upon the piano stool which Grace\n",
      "had vacated, and attacked the keys as if they were sheaves of wheat and\n",
      "he was wielding a flail. He played the music as he had played it to\n",
      "Caleb, with the accent and swing of a march, yet with all the runs and\n",
      "variations with which country worshippers are wont to embroider it, and\n",
      "the hearers were so \"wrought up\" by it that they began the hymn with a\n",
      "roaring \"attack\" that was startling even to themselves. Grace, seeing\n",
      "no seat within reach, and unwilling to turn her back to the people,\n",
      "retired to one end of the piano, under one of the candles, from which\n",
      "position, on the raised platform in front of the pulpit, she beheld\n",
      "a spectacle seldom seen in its fulness except by ministers during a\n",
      "time of religious excitement--a sea of faces, many of them full of the\n",
      "ecstacy of faith and anticipation, others wild with terror at the doom\n",
      "of the impenitent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most large-souled women, Grace was by nature religious and\n",
      "extremely sympathetic, and unconsciously she looked pityingly and\n",
      "beseechingly into many of the troubled faces. Her eyes rested an\n",
      "instant, unconsciously, on those of one of the stalwart sinners who\n",
      "had brought the piano to the church. In a second the man arose, strode\n",
      "forward, and dropped upon his knees. Grace looked at another,--for the\n",
      "six were together on one bench,--and he, too, came forward. Then a\n",
      "strange tumult took possession of her; she looked commandingly at the\n",
      "others in succession, and in a moment the entire six were on their\n",
      "knees at the altar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great hell!\" bellowed the ruffian who had been tossed through the\n",
      "window, into which he had climbed halfway back in his eagerness to hear\n",
      "the music. Then he tumbled into the church, got upon his feet, and\n",
      "hurried forward to join the other sinners at the mourners' bench, which\n",
      "had already become so crowded that Caleb was pressing the saints from\n",
      "the front seats to make room for coming penitents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hymn ended, but Philip did not know it, so he continued to play.\n",
      "Grace whispered to him, and when he had reached the last bar, which\n",
      "he ended with a crash, he abruptly seated himself on the pulpit steps\n",
      "and felt as if he had done something dreadful and been caught in the\n",
      "act. Grace reseated herself at the instrument; and as the minister,\n",
      "with the class leaders, Sunday-school teachers, and other prominent\n",
      "members of the church were moving among the penitents, counselling and\n",
      "praying, and the regular order of song and prayer had been abandoned or\n",
      "forgotten, she played the music of the hymns that had been designated\n",
      "by the minister on the previous day. Some of the music was plaintive,\n",
      "some spirited, but she played all with extreme feeling, whether the\n",
      "people sang or merely listened. She played also all newer church music\n",
      "that had appealed to her in recent years, and when, at a very late\n",
      "hour, the congregation was dismissed, she suddenly became conscious of\n",
      "the most extreme exhaustion she had ever known. As she and her husband\n",
      "were leaving the church, one of the penitents approached them and\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless the Lord for that pianner--the Lord an' you two folks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Amen!\" said several others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip and Grace walked home in silence; but when they were within\n",
      "doors, Philip took his wife's hands in his, held them apart, looked\n",
      "into Grace's eyes, which seemed to be melting, and exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grace Somerton--my wife--a revivalist!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Saul also among the prophets?\" Grace retorted, with a smile which\n",
      "seemed to her husband entirely new and peculiar. \"It was your music\n",
      "that started the--what shall I call it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VII--AN ACTIVE PARTNER\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE piano remained at the church several days, for the revival effort\n",
      "was too successful to be discontinued. Night after night Grace played\n",
      "for saints and sinners, and the minister, who was far too honest\n",
      "to stretch the truth for the sake of a compliment, told her that\n",
      "the playing drew more penitents than his prayers and sermons. Caleb\n",
      "remained faithful to his duties at the store every day, but the sound\n",
      "of the church bell in the evening made him so manifestly uneasy, and\n",
      "eager to respond, that Philip volunteered to look after all customers\n",
      "and loungers who might come in before the customary time for closing.\n",
      "But customers and loungers were few; for the church was temporarily the\n",
      "centre of interest to all of the good and bad whose evenings were free.\n",
      "There was no other place for Philip himself to go after the store was\n",
      "closed, for was not his wife there? Besides, the work soon began to\n",
      "tell on Grace; for the meetings were long, and the air of the tightly\n",
      "packed little church became very stifling, so Philip sometimes relieved\n",
      "Grace so that she might go to the door for fresh air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what you two have done, with your pianner-playin'?\" asked\n",
      "Caleb, when the revival concluded. \"You've not only snatched a lot of\n",
      "sinners that have been dodgin' ev'rybody else for years, but folks is\n",
      "so grateful to you that four or five customers of other stores are\n",
      "goin' to give you their trade the comin' year. I was sure 'twould work\n",
      "that way, but I didn't like to tell you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad you didn't; for if you had, the music would have stopped\n",
      "abruptly. There are places to draw the line in advertising one's\n",
      "business,--my business,--and the church is one of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good! That's just the way I thought you'd feel, but I'm mighty glad to\n",
      "know it for sure. Church singin' 'll be mighty dismal, though, when you\n",
      "take that pianner back home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Caleb spoke, he looked beseechingly at Philip, who utterly ignored\n",
      "the look and maintained an impassive face. Then Caleb transferred his\n",
      "mute appeal to Grace, who looked troubled and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There ought to be some way out of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where there's a will, there's a way,\" Caleb suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip frowned, then laughed, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose you think up a way--but don't let there be any delay about\n",
      "getting the piano back to the house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's a means of grace at the church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is at home, and I need all the means of grace I can get,\n",
      "particularly those that are nearest home, while I am breaking myself in\n",
      "to a new business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb had the piano brought back to the parlor, but he reverted to it\n",
      "again and again, in season and out of season, until Philip told Grace\n",
      "that there was no doubt that his uncle was right when he wrote that\n",
      "Caleb would sometimes insist on being helped with projects of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That wasn't all,\" Grace replied. \"He wrote also that he advised\n",
      "you to give Caleb his way at such times, or your life would be made\n",
      "miserable until you did, and that the cost of Caleb's projects would\n",
      "not be great.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! I wonder if uncle knew the cost of a high-grade upright piano?\n",
      "Besides, I need all my time and wits for the business, and Caleb's\n",
      "interruptions about that piano are worrying the life out of me. To\n",
      "make matters worse, there's a new set of commercial travellers coming\n",
      "in almost every day--this is the season, while country merchants are\n",
      "beginning to get money, in which they hope to make small sales for\n",
      "quick pay, and they take a lot of my time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ought to have a partner--and you have one, you know--to see those\n",
      "people for you; and she will do it, if you'll let her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My partner knows that she may and shall do whatever she likes,\" said\n",
      "Philip, \"but, dear girl, 'twould be like sending a sheep among wolves\n",
      "to unloose that horde of drummers upon you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've had to deal with men, in some city stores in which I worked,\"\n",
      "Grace replied, \"and some of them reminded me of wolves--and other\n",
      "animals; but I succeeded in keeping them in their places. I know the\n",
      "private costmarks on all of our goods, and I know the qualities of many\n",
      "kinds of goods better than you or Caleb, and both of you will be within\n",
      "call for consultation whenever I'm puzzled; so let me try. 'Twill give\n",
      "me an excuse to spend all of my spare time in the store; so whenever a\n",
      "drummer comes in, you can refer him to me. Say I'm the buyer for the\n",
      "concern. 'Twill sound big; don't you think so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I do! I wonder where a young woman got such a head for\n",
      "business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strange, isn't it,\" Grace replied, with dancing eyes which had also\n",
      "a quizzical expression, \"as she's been several years behind counters,\n",
      "great and small, and listened to scores of buyers and drummers haggle\n",
      "over fractions of a cent in prices?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And for about that much time,\" said Philip, reminiscently, \"her\n",
      "husband was a mere clerk and correspondent, yet thought himself a\n",
      "rising business man! Have your own way, partner--managing partner, I\n",
      "ought to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day was a very busy one, yet Caleb found time to say something\n",
      "about instrumental music as a means of grace in churches, and to get a\n",
      "sharp reply. Several commercial travellers came in and were astonished\n",
      "at being referred to a handsome, well-dressed young woman. Grace\n",
      "disposed of them rapidly and apparently without trouble. When husband\n",
      "and wife sat down to supper, Philip said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did the managing partner get along to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I bought very little,\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You saved Caleb and me a lot of time. I've never seen Caleb so active\n",
      "and spirited as he has been this afternoon. It made me feel guilty,\n",
      "for I was rude to him this morning for the first time. Just when I was\n",
      "trying to think my hardest about something, he brought up again the\n",
      "subject of the church and the piano.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor Caleb! But he won't do it again, for I've settled the matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've not been tender-hearted enough to give up the piano?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, but I--we, I mean--have taken the county agency for a\n",
      "cabinet-organ firm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see--e--e! And you're going to torment the church into buying one,\n",
      "and you and Caleb are going to get up strawberry festivals and such\n",
      "things to raise the money, and the upshot will be that I'll have to\n",
      "subscribe a lot of cash to make up the deficiency. Ah, well, peace will\n",
      "be cheap at--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil, dear, don't be so dreadfully previous. The bargain is that the\n",
      "firm shall send us, without charge, a specimen instrument, which I've\n",
      "promised to display to the best advantage, and I've also promised to\n",
      "give elementary instruction to every one who manifests interest in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grace Somerton! The house will be full from morning till night.\n",
      "Country people will throng about such an instrument like children about\n",
      "a hand-organ. 'Twill be the end of your coming into the store to talk\n",
      "to the drummers, or even to see me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil! Where are your wits? I'm going to have the organ kept at\n",
      "the church, and let the most promising would-be learners and possible\n",
      "buyers do their practising there. The organ firm sells on instalments;\n",
      "we'll guarantee the instalments, for I'll select the buyers--who will\n",
      "want only smaller instruments--from among women who bring us chickens\n",
      "and butter and eggs and feathers and such things. So the church will\n",
      "be sure of an instrument more appropriate to congregational singing\n",
      "than a piano, and our piano won't be coveted, and we will make a little\n",
      "money, and by the time the next revival season arrives there will be at\n",
      "least a few people who can play, and perhaps some who are accustomed to\n",
      "closed windows and stuffy air, and won't get splitting headaches and\n",
      "lose five pounds of weight in a week, as I did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Allow me to catch my breath!\" said Philip. \"Give me some tea, please,\n",
      "quick!--no milk or sugar. I hope 'tis very strong. You've planned all\n",
      "this, yet there you sit, as natural and unassuming as if you'd never\n",
      "thought of anything but keeping house and being the sweetest wife in\n",
      "the world!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, but shouldn't sweetness have any strength and character?\n",
      "And what is business for, I should like to know, but to enable women\n",
      "to keep house--and keep their pianos, if they have any?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb,\" said Philip, on returning to the store, \"I want to apologize\n",
      "for answering you rudely this morning about that enraging piano. I was\n",
      "in a hard study over--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't mention it,\" said Caleb, with a beatific smile. \"Besides,\n",
      "'Providence tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,' as the Bible says in\n",
      "hundreds of different ways. I s'pose your wife's told you what she's\n",
      "done about music for the church? Je--ru--salem! Ain't she a peeler,\n",
      "though?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is indeed--if I may assume that a 'peeler' is an incomparable\n",
      "combination of goodness and good sense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's about the meanin' of it, in my dictionary.\" Then Caleb fixed\n",
      "his eyes inquiringly upon Philip's face and kept them there so long\n",
      "that Philip asked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What now, Caleb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothin',\" said Caleb, suddenly looking embarrassed. \"That is, nothin'\n",
      "that's any o' my business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If 'twas mine, you needn't hesitate to mention it. You and I ought to\n",
      "be fair and frank with each other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Caleb, counting with a stubby forefinger the inches on a\n",
      "yardstick, \"I was only wonderin'--that is, I want to say that you're a\n",
      "good deal of a man, an' one that I'm satisfied it's safe to tie to, an'\n",
      "I'm mighty glad you're in your uncle's place, but--for the land's sake,\n",
      "how'd you come to git her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip laughed heartily, and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As most men get wives. I asked her to marry me. First, of course, I\n",
      "put my best foot forward, for a long time, and kept it there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course. But didn't the other fellers try to cut you out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite likely, for most men have eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wa'n't any of 'em millionnaires?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Probably not, though I never inquired. As she herself has told you,\n",
      "Mrs. Somerton was a saleswoman. Millionnaires do their courting in\n",
      "their own set, where saleswomen can't afford to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was great luck for you, wasn't it? Are there any women like her\n",
      "in their set?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't doubt they think so. Mrs. Somerton says there are plenty of\n",
      "them in every set, rich and poor alike. As for me,--'There's Only One\n",
      "Girl in the World'--you've heard the song?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't say that I have,\" Caleb replied, suddenly looking thoughtful,\n",
      "\"but the idea of it's straight goods an' a yard wide. Well, sir, it's\n",
      "plain to me, an' pretty much ev'rybody else, that that wife o' yourn is\n",
      "the greatest human blessin' that ever struck these parts. Good women\n",
      "ain't scarce here; neither is good an' smart women. I s'pose our folks\n",
      "look pretty common to you, 'cause of their clothes, but they improve on\n",
      "acquaintance. Speakin' o' clothes--ev'rybody, even the best o' folks,\n",
      "fall short o' perfection in some particular, you know. The only way\n",
      "Mis' Somerton can ever do any harm, 'pears to me, is by always bein' so\n",
      "well dressed as to discourage some other women, an' makin' a lot of the\n",
      "gals envious an' discontented. She don't wear no di'monds nor gewgaws,\n",
      "I know, but for all that, she looks, day in an' day out, as if she\n",
      "was all fixed for a party or Sunday-school picnic, an'--But, say, 'I\n",
      "shouldn't wonder if I was on dangerous ground,' as one of our recruits\n",
      "remarked to me at Gettysburg after most of our regiment was killed or\n",
      "wounded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" exclaimed Philip, when he rejoined his wife after the store\n",
      "closed for the day. \"'Pride must have a fall'--that is, supposing\n",
      "you were proud of silencing Caleb concerning the piano. He has a\n",
      "torment in preparation for you, personally. He thinks you dress too\n",
      "handsomely--wear party clothes every day, and are likely to upset the\n",
      "heads of the village girls, and some women old enough to know better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Grace, flushing indignantly. \"I've absolutely no\n",
      "clothes but those I owned when we were poor. I thought them good enough\n",
      "for another season, as no one here would have seen them before, and\n",
      "none of them was very badly worn.\" She arose, stood before the chamber\n",
      "mirror, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This entire dress is made of bits of others, that were two, three, or\n",
      "four years old, and were painfully cheap when new.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even if they weren't,\" said Philip, \"they were your own, and earned\n",
      "by hard work, and if ever again Caleb opens his head on the subject,\n",
      "I'll--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't! I don't know what you were going to do, but please\n",
      "don't. Leave Master Caleb to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't expect to reason him into believing that you're less\n",
      "effectively dressed than you are?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I expect to silence him for all time,\" Grace replied, again\n",
      "contemplating herself in the mirror, and appearing not dissatisfied\n",
      "with what she saw. The next day she asked Caleb which, if any, of the\n",
      "calicoes in the store were least salable; the cheapest, commonest stuff\n",
      "possible, for kitchen wear. Caleb \"reckoned\" aloud that the best calico\n",
      "was cheap enough for the store-owner's wife, but Grace persisted, so\n",
      "she was shown the \"dead stock,\"--the leavings of several seasons'\n",
      "goods,--from which she made two selections. Caleb eyed them with\n",
      "disfavor, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That purple one ain't fast color; the yaller one is knowed all over\n",
      "the county as the Scare-Cow calico. We might 'a' worked it off on\n",
      "somebody, if the first an' only dress of it we sold hadn't skeered a\n",
      "cow so bad that she kicked, an' broke the ankle of the gal that was\n",
      "milkin' her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, Caleb; the purple one can afford to lose some of its\n",
      "color, and--oh, I'll see about the other.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three days later Grace, enveloped in a water-proof cloak, hurried\n",
      "through a shower from the house to the store, and on entering the\n",
      "back room, threw off the cloak. Caleb, who was drawing vinegar from a\n",
      "barrel, arose suddenly, with a half-gallon measure in his hands, and\n",
      "groaned to see his employer's wife, \"dressed,\" as he said afterward,\n",
      "\"like a queen just goin' onto a throne, though, come to think of it,\n",
      "I never set eyes on a queen, nor a throne, either.\" More deplorable\n",
      "still, she looked proud, and conscious, and as if demanding admiration.\n",
      "There was even a suspicion of a wink as she exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be careful not to let any of that vinegar run over and splash near me,\n",
      "Caleb! You know the purple isn't fast color!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je--ru--salem!\" exclaimed Caleb, dropping the measure and its\n",
      "contents, which Grace escaped by tripping backward to the shelter of a\n",
      "stack of grain-sacks. When she emerged, with a grand courtesy followed\n",
      "by a long, honest laugh, Caleb continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've read of folk's bein' clothed in purple an' fine linen, but\n",
      "purple an' Scare-Cow knocks me flat! Dressed in 'dead stock,' from\n",
      "head to foot, an' yit--Hello, Philip! Come in here! Oh! You're knocked\n",
      "pretty flat, too, ain't you? Well, I just wanted to take back what I\n",
      "said the other day about some folk's clothes. I don't b'lieve a dress\n",
      "made of them grain-sacks would look common on her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How stupid of me!\" Grace exclaimed. \"Why didn't I think of the\n",
      "grain-sacks? I might have corded the seams with heavy dark twine, or\n",
      "piped them with red carpet-binding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what cordin' an' pipin' is,\" said Caleb, \"but after what\n",
      "I've seen, I can believe that you'd only need to rummage in a big\n",
      "rag-bag awhile to dress like a queen--or look like one.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "VIII--THE PORK-HOUSE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "COLD weather and the pork-packing season had arrived, and the lower\n",
      "floor of Somerton's warehouse was a busier place than the store. At\n",
      "one side \"dressed\" hogs, unloaded from farmers' wagons, were piled\n",
      "high; in the centre a man with a cleaver lopped the heads and feet\n",
      "from the carcasses, and divided the remainder into hams, shoulders,\n",
      "and sides, which another man trimmed into commercial shape; a third\n",
      "packed the product in salted layers on the other side. At the rear\n",
      "of the room two men cut the trimmings, carefully separating the lean\n",
      "from the fat, and with the latter filled, once in two or three hours,\n",
      "some huge iron kettles which sat in a brick furnace in the corner. At\n",
      "similar intervals the contents of the kettles were transferred to the\n",
      "hopper of a large press, not unlike a cider press, and soon an odorous\n",
      "wine-colored fluid streamed into a tank below, from which it was ladled\n",
      "through tin funnels into large, closely hooped barrels. The room\n",
      "was cold, despite the furnace; the walls, windows, and ceiling were\n",
      "reminiscent of the dust and smell of many pork-packing seasons. Early\n",
      "in the season Philip had dubbed the pork-packing floor \"Bluebeard's\n",
      "Chamber,\" and warned his wife never to enter it. After a single glance\n",
      "one day, through the street door of the warehouse, Grace assured her\n",
      "husband that the prohibition was entirely unnecessary. She also said\n",
      "that she never had been fond of pork, but that in the future she would\n",
      "eschew ham, bacon, sausage, lard, and all other pork products.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the sound of rapid, heavy hammering was audible in the Somerton\n",
      "sitting room and parlor, and when Grace asked where it came from,\n",
      "Philip replied, \"The pork-house;\" the cooper was packing barrels of\n",
      "sides, hams, or shoulders for shipment, or tightening the hoops of\n",
      "lard-barrels which were inclined to leak. When Grace wondered whence\n",
      "came the great flakes of soot on table-linen which had been hung out\n",
      "of doors to dry, Philip replied, \"The pork-house;\" probably the fire\n",
      "in the furnace was drawing badly and smoking too much. Frequently,\n",
      "when she went to the store and asked Caleb where her husband was, the\n",
      "reply would be, \"The pork-house.\" If Philip reached home late for a\n",
      "meal, and Grace asked what had kept him, he was almost certain to\n",
      "reply, \"The pork-house,\" and if, as frequently occurred later in the\n",
      "season, he retired so late that Grace thought she had slept through\n",
      "half the night, he groaned, in answer to her inevitable question, \"The\n",
      "pork-house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came a day when Grace detected an unfamiliar and unpleasing odor\n",
      "in the house. She suspected the napkins, then the tablecloth, and\n",
      "examined the rug under the dining-room table for possible spots of\n",
      "butter. Next she inspected the kitchen, which she washed and scoured\n",
      "industriously for a full day. Occasionally she detected the same odor\n",
      "in the store, as if she had carried it with her from the house, so she\n",
      "examined her dresses minutely, for the odor was reminiscent of cookery\n",
      "of some kind, although she had but a single dress for kitchen wear,\n",
      "and never wore it out of the house. She mentioned the odor to Philip,\n",
      "but he was unable to detect it in the air. One day it inflicted itself\n",
      "upon her even in church, and became so obnoxious that she spoke of it,\n",
      "instead of the sermon, as soon as the congregation was dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very sorry, dear girl, that you're so tormented,\" said Philip. \"I\n",
      "wish I could identify the nuisance; then possibly I could find means\n",
      "to abate it. I know an odor is hard to describe, but do try to give me\n",
      "some clew to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It reminds me somewhat of stale butter,\" Grace replied slowly, \"and\n",
      "of some kinds of greasy pans, and of burned meat, and of parts of some\n",
      "tenement-house streets in the city, and some ash-cans on city sidewalks\n",
      "on hot summer mornings--oh, those days!--and of--I don't know what\n",
      "else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've already named enough to show that 'tis truly disgusting and\n",
      "dreadful, and I do wish you and I could exchange the one of the five\n",
      "senses which is affected by it, for I never had much sense of smell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time they were at home. Philip was unclasping his wife's cloak\n",
      "when Grace exclaimed suddenly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There it is!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There what is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That dreadful odor! Why, Phil, 'tis on your coat-sleeve! What, in the\n",
      "name of all that's mysterious--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was my best coat in the city last winter, and I've never worn it\n",
      "here, except on Sundays.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it must have taken the odor from some other garment in your\n",
      "closet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip hurriedly brought his ordinary weekday coat to the sitting\n",
      "room, Grace moved it slowly, suspiciously, toward her nose, and soon\n",
      "exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There it is--ugh! But what can it be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant a well-known knock at the door announced Caleb, who had\n",
      "been invited to Sunday dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be shocked, Caleb,\" said Philip; \"we're not mending clothes on\n",
      "Sunday. 'Twill scarcely be an appetizer, apparently, but won't you pass\n",
      "this coat to and fro before your face a moment, and detect an odor, if\n",
      "you can, and tell us what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb took the coat, did as requested, touched the cloth with his nose,\n",
      "and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pork-house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean?\" Philip asked, while Grace turned pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the smell of boilin' fat, from the lard-kettles. It's powerful\n",
      "pervadin' of ev'rythin', specially woollen clothes, an' men's hair,\n",
      "when the pork-house windows an' doors are shut. It makes me mortal sick\n",
      "sometimes, when the malary gets a new grip on me; at such times I know\n",
      "a pork-house worker when I pass him in the street in the dark. To save\n",
      "myself from myself I used to wear an oilcloth jacket an' overalls when\n",
      "I worked in the pork-house--your uncle an' I used to have to put in a\n",
      "good many hours there. There was somethin' else I used to do too, when\n",
      "I got to my room, though I never dared to tell your uncle, or he'd\n",
      "never ha' stopped laughin' at me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was it? Tell me--quick!\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I bought a bottle of Floridy water out of the store,--it's a\n",
      "stuff that some of the gals use,--an' I sprinkled a little ev'ry day,\n",
      "mornin' an' evenin', on the carpet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip hurried to a bed-chamber, and came back with Grace's\n",
      "cologne-bottle, the contents of which he bestowed upon the rug under\n",
      "the dining table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ort to kill the rat,\" said Caleb, approvingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was a good one, but Grace ate sparingly, though she talked\n",
      "with animation and brilliancy unusual even for her, Philip imagined.\n",
      "For himself, he felt as he thought a detected criminal, an outcast,\n",
      "must feel. Excusing himself abruptly, he relieved his feelings somewhat\n",
      "by throwing out of doors the offending coat and the garments pertaining\n",
      "to it; then he threw out all the woollen garments of his wardrobe.\n",
      "Caleb was not due at Sunday school until three o'clock, but he excused\n",
      "himself an hour early. As he started, he signalled Philip in a manner\n",
      "familiar in the store, to follow him, and when both were outside the\n",
      "door, he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon she needs quinine, or somethin'. Touchiness 'bout smells is a\n",
      "sign. I'd get Doc Taggess to come down, if I was you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip thanked him for the suggestion; then he hurried to the\n",
      "bath-room, washed his hair and mustache, and exchanged his clothes\n",
      "for a thinner suit which he exhumed from a trunk. It was redolent of\n",
      "camphor, which he detested, but it was \"all the perfumes of Araby\"\n",
      "compared with--the pork-house. Then he rejoined Grace and made haste to\n",
      "officiate as assistant scullion, and also to ejaculate:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That infernal pork-house!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't talk of it any more to-day,\" Grace said, with a piteous smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I help it, when--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must help it, Phil dear. Really you must.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip made haste to change the subject of conversation, and to cheer\n",
      "his wife and escape from his own thoughts he tried to be humorous, and\n",
      "finally succeeded so well that he and Grace became as merry in their\n",
      "little kitchen as they ever had been anywhere. Indeed, Grace recovered\n",
      "her spirits so splendidly that of her own accord she recalled the\n",
      "pork-house, and said many amusing things about \"Bluebeard's Chamber,\"\n",
      "and told how curious and jealous Philip's prohibition had made her, and\n",
      "Philip replied that it contained more trunkless heads than the fateful\n",
      "closet of Bluebeard, and that it was a treasure-house besides; for\n",
      "through it passed most of the store's business that directly produced\n",
      "money. Then he dashed at the piano and played a lot of music so lively\n",
      "that it would have shocked the church people had they heard it, and\n",
      "Grace lounged in an easy-chair, with her eyes half closed, looking the\n",
      "picture of dreamy contentment. Later she composed herself among the\n",
      "pillows of a lounge, and asked Philip to throw an afghan over her,\n",
      "and sit beside her, and talk about old times in the city, and then\n",
      "to remind her of all their newer blessings, because she wished to be\n",
      "very, fully, reverently grateful for them. Philip was not loath to\n",
      "comply with her request; for though the month's work had been very\n",
      "exacting and hard, he had been assured by Caleb, within twenty-four\n",
      "hours, that it was the largest and most profitable month of business\n",
      "that the Somerton store had ever done, and that beyond a doubt the new\n",
      "proprietor had \"caught on,\" and held all the old customers, and of his\n",
      "own ability secured several new ones, which proved that the people of\n",
      "the town and county \"took to\" him.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this Philip repeated to Grace, who dreamily said that it was very\n",
      "good, and a satisfaction to have her husband prominent among men,\n",
      "instead of a nobody--a splendid, incomparable, adorable one, but still\n",
      "really a nobody, among the hundreds of thousands of men in New York.\n",
      "Then both of them fell to musing as the twilight deepened. Musing,\n",
      "twilight, and temporary relief from the strain of the week's work\n",
      "combined to send Philip into a gentle doze, from which he suddenly\n",
      "roused himself to say:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you laughing at, Miss Mischief?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm--not--laughing,\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Crying? My dear girl, what is the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm--not--crying. I'm--merely--shivering. I'm cold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's because you've a brute of a husband, who has been so wrapped\n",
      "up in his affairs and you that probably he has let the fire go out.\"\n",
      "He made haste to replenish the stove and to throw over his wife a\n",
      "traveller's rug. Then he lighted a shaded candle, looked at the\n",
      "thermometer, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange! The mercury stands at seventy-two degrees.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Grace continued to shiver, and, stranger still, she felt colder as\n",
      "the fire burned up and additional covers were placed upon her. Finally\n",
      "she exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Phil! I'm frightened! This is something--different from--ordinary\n",
      "cold. It must be some--something like--paralysis. I can't move my arms\n",
      "or feet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll run for Doctor Taggess at once!\" said Philip; but as he started\n",
      "from the room, Grace half screamed, half groaned:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't leave me, if you--love me! Don't let me--die--alone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At least let me go to the door and raise a shout; some one will hear\n",
      "me, and I'll send him for the Doctor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As he opened the door he saw a light in the window of Caleb's room,\n",
      "over the store. Quickly seizing the cord of the alarm signal, of which\n",
      "Caleb had previously told him, he pulled several times, and soon Caleb,\n",
      "finding the door ajar, entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you get the Doctor, Caleb--quick?\" said Philip. \"We're awfully\n",
      "frightened; my wife has a strange, dreadful attack of some kind. It\n",
      "acts like paralysis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb, glancing toward the lounge, saw the quivering covers and Grace's\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor little woman!\" he said, with the voice of a woman. \"But don't be\n",
      "frightened. 'Tisn't paralysis. It's bad enough, but it never kills. I\n",
      "know the symptoms as well as I know my own right hand, an' Doctor'll do\n",
      "more good later in the evenin' than now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what is it, man?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Malary--fever an' ager. She's never had a chill before, I reckon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--o--o,\" said Grace, between chattering teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't wonder you was scared, then. If religion could take hold\n",
      "like an ager-chill, this part of the country would be a section o'\n",
      "kingdom-come. The mean thing about it is that it takes hardest hold\n",
      "of folks that's been the healthiest. Try not to be scared, though;\n",
      "it won't kill, an' 'twon't last but a few minutes. Then you're likely\n",
      "to drop asleep, an' wake pretty soon with a hot fever an' splittin'\n",
      "headache; they ain't pleasant to look forward to, but they might seem\n",
      "worse if you didn't foresee 'em. I'll go for Doc Taggess right off;\n",
      "if he ain't home, his wife'll send him as soon as he comes. Taggess\n",
      "himself is the best medicine he carries; but if he's off somewhere,\n",
      "I'll come back an' tell your husband what to do. Don't be afeared to\n",
      "trust me; ev'ry man o' sense in this section o' country knows what to\n",
      "do for fever and ager; if he didn't, he'd have to go out o' business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb departed, after again saying \"Poor little woman!\" very tenderly.\n",
      "As for Philip, he took his wife's hands in his own and poured forth\n",
      "a torrent of sympathetic words; but when the sufferer fell asleep,\n",
      "he went out into the darkness and cursed malaria, the West, and the\n",
      "impulse which had made him become his uncle's heir. He cursed many\n",
      "things else, and then concentrated the remainder of his wrath into an\n",
      "anathema on the pork-house.\n",

      "IX--A WESTERN SPECTRE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "AFTER her fever had subsided, Grace went to sleep and carried into\n",
      "dream-land the disquieting conviction that she was to have a long\n",
      "period of illness, and be confined to her bed. Philip had given her\n",
      "the medicines prescribed and obtained by Caleb, for Doctor Taggess had\n",
      "gone far into the country and was not expected home until morning.\n",
      "Then Philip had lain awake far into the night, planning proper care\n",
      "for his precious invalid; finally he decided to get a trained nurse\n",
      "from New York, unless Doctor Taggess could recommend one nearer home.\n",
      "He would also get from the city a trained housekeeper; for, as already\n",
      "explained, there was no servant class at Claybanks, and of what use\n",
      "was \"help\" when the head of the house was too ill to direct the work?\n",
      "He would order from the city every cordial, every sick-room delicacy,\n",
      "that he could think of, or the Doctor might suggest. Expense was not\n",
      "to be thought of; there was only one woman and wife in the world--to\n",
      "him, and she had been cruelly struck down. She should be made well, at\n",
      "whatever cost. Meanwhile he would write the firm by which he had been\n",
      "employed in New York, and beg for his old position, for the reason that\n",
      "the climate of Claybanks was seriously undermining his wife's health;\n",
      "afterward, as soon as Grace could be moved, he would take her back\n",
      "to the city, and give up his Claybanks property, with its train of\n",
      "responsibilities, privations, and miseries.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he awoke in the morning, he slipped softly from the room, which\n",
      "he had darkened the night before, so that the morning light should\n",
      "not disturb the invalid, and he moved toward the kitchen to make a\n",
      "fire--a morning duty with which he had charged himself and faithfully\n",
      "fulfilled since his first day in his uncle's house. To be in the store\n",
      "by sunrise, as was the winter custom of Claybanks merchants, compelled\n",
      "Philip to rise before daylight, and habit, first induced by an alarm\n",
      "clock, had made him wake every winter day at six, while darkness was\n",
      "still deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was startled, therefore, when he tip-toed into the dining room, to\n",
      "be welcomed by a burst of sunlight. Evidently his wakefulness of the\n",
      "previous night had caused him to oversleep. Hurrying to the kitchen,\n",
      "he was again startled, for breakfast was cooking on the stove, and at\n",
      "the table, measuring some ground coffee into a pot, stood Grace, softly\n",
      "singing, as was her custom when she worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" he exclaimed, rubbing his eyes. \"Was it I who was ill, instead\n",
      "of you, or have I been bereft of my senses for a fortnight or more?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither, you poor, dear boy,\" Grace replied, though without looking\n",
      "up. \"Yesterday I was more scared than hurt; to-day I feel as well as\n",
      "ever--really, I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip stepped in front of her, took her head in his hands, and\n",
      "looked into her face. The healthy glow peculiar to it had given place\n",
      "to a sickly yellow tint; her plump cheeks had flattened--almost\n",
      "hollowed, her eyes, always either lustrous or melting, were dull and\n",
      "expressionless, and her lips, usually ruddy and full, were gray and\n",
      "thin. As her husband looked at her, she burst into tears and hid her\n",
      "face on his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could have endured anything but that,\" she sobbed. \"I don't think\n",
      "I'm vain, but it has always been so delightful to me that I could be\n",
      "pretty to my husband. I wasn't conceited, but I had to believe my\n",
      "mirror. But now--oh, I'd like to hide my face somewhere for a--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you, indeed?\" murmured Philip, tenderly. \"Let me hide it\n",
      "for you, a little at a time; I promise you that not a bit shall be\n",
      "neglected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do let me breathe, Phil. I don't see how you can kiss a scarecrow--and\n",
      "continue at it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you? I could kiss a plague-patient, or the living skeleton, if\n",
      "Grace Somerton's heart was in it. I don't understand your reference to\n",
      "a scarecrow. Your mirror must have been untruthful this morning, or\n",
      "perhaps covered with mist, for--see!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he detached the late Mr. Jethro Somerton's tiny mirror from\n",
      "the kitchen wall and held it before his wife, whose astonishment and\n",
      "delight were great as she exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil, you're a witch! Now I'm going to make believe that there was no\n",
      "yesterday, and if yesterday persists in coming to mind, I shall scold\n",
      "myself most savagely for having been a frightened, silly child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You really were a very sick woman,\" Philip replied. \"I was quite as\n",
      "frightened at you while the chill had possession of you, and you had\n",
      "a raging fever afterward. You've had headaches in other days, but\n",
      "yesterday's was the first that made you moan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis very strange. I feel quite as well to-day as ever I did. Perhaps\n",
      "'tis the effect of Caleb's medicine. Poor Caleb! When he saw me, I\n",
      "really believe he suffered as much as I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it seemed to me,\" said Philip. \"I wonder how a little, sickly,\n",
      "always-tired man can have so much sympathy and tenderness?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You forget that he, himself, is malaria-poisoned, as your uncle's\n",
      "letter said. Probably he's had just such chills as mine. Let's make\n",
      "haste to thank him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a hurried breakfast, husband and wife went together to the store,\n",
      "and found Caleb awaiting them at the back door. He had already seen\n",
      "Grace's figure at the window of the sitting room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je--ru--salem!\" he exclaimed, looking intently at Grace. \"I never saw\n",
      "a worse shake than yourn, which is sayin' a mighty lot, considerin'\n",
      "I was born an' raised in the West. But you look just as good as new.\n",
      "Well, there's somethin' good in ev'rythin', if you look far enough for\n",
      "it--even in an ager-chill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good in a chill, indeed!\" Philip exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; its good p'int is that it don't last long. Havin' a chill's like\n",
      "bein' converted; if somethin' didn't shut down on the excitement pretty\n",
      "quick, there'd be nothin' left o' the subject. Well, seein' you're\n",
      "here, I reckon I'd better take a look in the pork-house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has sprinkled the floor with Florida water!\" said Grace, as she\n",
      "entered the store. \"Evidently he didn't doubt that I'd be well this\n",
      "morning, and he remembers yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within an hour Doctor Taggess and his wife bustled into the store, and\n",
      "Mrs. Taggess hurried to Grace, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd have come to you yesterday, my dear, if I hadn't known I could be\n",
      "of no use. Chills are like cyclones; they'll have their own way while\n",
      "they last, and everything put in their way makes them more troublesome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor consulted Philip, apart, as to what had been done, approved\n",
      "of Caleb's treatment, and gave additional directions; then he turned\n",
      "upon Grace his kind eyes and pleasant smile, which Caleb had rightly\n",
      "intimated were his best medicines, and he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, has Doctor Caleb found time to give you his favorite theory,\n",
      "which is that a chill or any other malarial product is a means of\n",
      "grace?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb values his life too highly to advance such a theory at present,\"\n",
      "Philip answered for his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so, just so. Well, there's a time for everything, but Caleb isn't\n",
      "entirely wrong on that subject. There are other and less painful and\n",
      "entirely sufficient means of grace, however, from which one can choose,\n",
      "so chills aren't necessary--for that particular purpose, and I hope you\n",
      "won't have any more of them. I'm afraid you forgot some of the advice\n",
      "I gave you, the first time we met, about how to take care of yourself\n",
      "until you had become acclimated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip and Grace looked at each other sheepishly, and admitted that\n",
      "they had not forgotten, but neglected. They had felt so well, so\n",
      "strong, they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so, just so. Malaria's just like Satan, in many ways, but\n",
      "especially in sometimes appearing as an angel of light. At first it\n",
      "will stimulate every physical faculty of a healthy person like good\n",
      "wine, but suddenly--well, you know. I had my suspicions the last time I\n",
      "noticed your splendid complexion, but between mending broken limbs and\n",
      "broken heads, and old people leaving the world, and young people coming\n",
      "into it, I'm too busy to do all the work I lay out for myself. You may\n",
      "have one more chill--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Doctor!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twon't be so bad as the first one, unless it comes to-day. They have\n",
      "four different and regular periods--every day, every other day, once\n",
      "in three days, and once in seven days, and each is worse than all of\n",
      "the others combined--according to the person who has it. I'll soon cure\n",
      "yours, whichever kind it may be, and after that I'm going to get Mrs.\n",
      "Taggess to keep you in mind of the necessary precautions against new\n",
      "attacks, for I've special use for you in this town and county. I wonder\n",
      "if Caleb has told you that you, too, are a means of grace? No? Well,\n",
      "he's a modest chap, but he'll get to it yet, and I'll back him up. This\n",
      "county has needed a visible standard of physical health for young women\n",
      "to live up to, and you entirely fill the bill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't wonder, Doctor,\" said Philip, while Grace blushed, \"that,\n",
      "religious though you are, you sometimes agree with the sceptic who\n",
      "said that if he'd been the Creator of the world he'd have made health\n",
      "catching, instead of disease.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can't say that I do. Heaven knows I'm sick enough of sickness;\n",
      "no honest physician's bills pay him for the miseries he has to see, and\n",
      "think of, and fight; but health's very much like money--it's valued\n",
      "most by those who have to work hardest to get it: those who come by\n",
      "it easily are likely to squander it. I can't quite make out, by the\n",
      "ordinary signs, how your wife came by her own. I wonder if she'd object\n",
      "to telling me. I don't ask from mere curiosity, I assure you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid 'twill stimulate my self-esteem to tell,\" Grace replied,\n",
      "with heightening color, \"for I'm prouder of my health than of anything\n",
      "else--except my husband. I got it by sheer hard, long effort, through\n",
      "the necessity for six years, of going six days in the week, sick or\n",
      "well, rain or shine, to and from a store, and of standing up, for nine\n",
      "or ten hours a day while I was inside. To lose a day or two in such a\n",
      "store generally meant to lose one's place, so a girl couldn't afford to\n",
      "be sick, or even feeble.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha! Wife, did you hear that? Now, Mrs. Somerton, Claybanks and\n",
      "vicinity need you even more than I'd supposed. But--do try to have\n",
      "patience with me, for I'm a physician, you know, and what you tell me\n",
      "may be of great service to other young women; I won't use your name, if\n",
      "you object. Did you have good health from the first?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed! I was a thin, pale, little country girl when I went\n",
      "to the city; I'd worked so hard at school for years that all my\n",
      "vitality seemed to have gone to my head. Work in the store was cruelly\n",
      "hard,--indeed, it never became easy,--and I had headaches, backaches,\n",
      "dizzy times--oh, all sorts of aches and wearinesses. But in a great\n",
      "crowd of women there are always some with sharp eyes, and clear heads,\n",
      "and warm hearts, and sometimes the mother-feeling besides. I wasn't the\n",
      "only chronically tired girl in the place; most of the others looked\n",
      "and felt as I did. Well, some of the good women I've mentioned were\n",
      "perpetually warning us girls to be careful of our health, and telling\n",
      "us how to do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good! Good! What did they say--in general?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" said Grace, laughing, and then remaining silent a moment,\n",
      "as she seemed to be looking backward. \"For each said something in\n",
      "particular. All had hobbies. One thought diet was everything; with\n",
      "another it was the daily bath; others harped on long and regular\n",
      "sleep, or avoidance of excitement, or fresh air while sleeping, or\n",
      "clothes and the healthiest way to wear them, or exercise, or the proper\n",
      "position in which to stand, or on carrying the head and shoulders high,\n",
      "or deep breathing, or recreation, or religion, or avoidance of the tea,\n",
      "cake, and candy habit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well! Now tell me, please, which of these hobbies you adopted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of them--every one of them,\" Grace replied, with an emphatic toss\n",
      "of her head. \"First I tried one, with some benefit, then another, and\n",
      "two or three more, and finally the entire collection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah!\" shouted the Doctor. \"You can be worth more to the women\n",
      "hereabouts than a dozen doctors like me, if you will--and of course\n",
      "you will. Indeed, you must. One more question,--positively the last.\n",
      "You couldn't have been the only woman who profited by the advice you\n",
      "received?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no. In any of the stores in which I worked there were some strong,\n",
      "wholesome, grand women who had literally fought their way up to what\n",
      "they were, for small pay and long hours, and weariness at night, and\n",
      "many other things combined to make any special effort of self-denial\n",
      "very, very hard--too hard for some of the girls, I verily believe.\n",
      "I don't think I'm narrow or easily satisfied; sometimes I've been\n",
      "fastidious and slow in forming acquaintances, but among all the other\n",
      "women I've seen, or heard of, or read about, there aren't any for whom\n",
      "I'd exchange some of my sister--shopgirls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Saleswomen, if you please,\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well!\" drawled the Doctor, who had been looking fixedly at\n",
      "Grace. \"I don't wonder that you're what you are. Come along, wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Doctor and Mrs. Taggess departed, Grace said to her husband:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the highest compliment that I ever had.\" And Philip replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope 'tis good for chills.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "X--SHE WANTED TO KNOW\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "GRACE'S malarial attack was soon repulsed, but the memory of\n",
      "that Sunday chill remained vivid. So Grace followed the Doctor's\n",
      "instructions as carefully as if she were an invalid on the brink of the\n",
      "grave, and she compelled Philip also to heed the counsel of precaution\n",
      "which Doctor Taggess had given to both. From that time forward she\n",
      "took personal sympathetic interest in all malarial victims of whom\n",
      "she heard, especially in those who purchased from the great stock of\n",
      "proprietary medicines in Somerton's store. Not infrequently a farmer\n",
      "or villager would be seized by a chill while talking or transacting\n",
      "business in the store, and Grace, despite her own experience in a warm\n",
      "room and under many woollen coverings, could scarcely help begging him\n",
      "to accept the loan of heavy shawls from the store's stock, and to sit\n",
      "undisturbed by the fire in the back room. When she planned a Sunday\n",
      "dinner, at which Doctor Taggess and his wife were to be guests, it\n",
      "was partly for the purpose of questioning the Doctor about the origin\n",
      "of malaria, and of its peculiarities, which seemed almost as numerous\n",
      "as cases; but Philip assured her that busy doctors, like other men of\n",
      "affairs, hated nothing so much as to \"talk shop\" out of business hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately she gradually became too busy to have time in which to\n",
      "become a monomaniac on malaria. The specimen organ arrived, and\n",
      "was placed in the church, to the great edification of the people.\n",
      "Grace was for a time the only performer, but to prepare relief for\n",
      "herself, improve the quality of the congregational singing, and not\n",
      "without an eye to business, she organized an evening music class,\n",
      "and quickly trained several young women to play some of the simpler\n",
      "hymn-tunes,--and also to purchase organs on the instalment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "From music lessons to dress-making is a far cry, but the fame of the\n",
      "purple and \"Scare-Cow\" dress had pervaded the county, and all the\n",
      "girls wanted dresses like it, which was somewhat embarrassing after the\n",
      "stock of the two calicoes had been exhausted. Then there arose a demand\n",
      "for something equally lovely, pretty, nice, sweet, or scrumptious,\n",
      "according to the vocabulary of the demander, and Eastern jobbers of\n",
      "calicoes and other prints and cheap dress-goods were one day astonished\n",
      "to receive from \"Philip Somerton, late Jethro Somerton,\" a request for\n",
      "a full line of samples--the first request of the sort from that portion\n",
      "of the state. To be able to ask in a store, \"How would you make this\n",
      "up?\" and to get a satisfying answer, was a privilege which not even the\n",
      "most hopeful women of Claybanks had ever dared to expect, so the \"truck\n",
      "trade\" of the town and county--the business that came of women carrying\n",
      "eggs, butter, chickens, feathers, etc., to the stores to barter for\n",
      "goods--drifted almost entirely to Somerton's store, and caused John\n",
      "Henry Bustpodder, a matter-of-fact German merchant on the next block,\n",
      "to say publicly that if his wife should die he would shut up the store\n",
      "and leave it shut till he could get to New York and marry a shopgirl.\n",
      "\n",
      "By midspring Grace had quite as few idle moments as her husband\n",
      "or Caleb; for between housekeeping, music-teaching, talking with\n",
      "commercial travellers, and selling goods, she seldom found time to\n",
      "enjoy the horse and buggy that Philip had bought for her, and she often\n",
      "told her husband, in mock complaint, that she worked longer hours than\n",
      "she had ever done in New York, and that she really must have an advance\n",
      "of pay if he did not wish her to transfer her abilities and customers\n",
      "to some rival establishment. Yet she enjoyed the work; she had a keen\n",
      "sense of humor, which sharpened the same sense in others, and when\n",
      "women were at the counter, she frequently found excuse to start a\n",
      "chorus of laughter. To her husband, a customer was merely a customer;\n",
      "to Grace he was frequently a character, and she had seen so few\n",
      "characters in the course of her New York experiences that she rejoiced\n",
      "in the change. She was sympathetic, too, so the younger women talked to\n",
      "her of much besides \"truck\" and goods. When one day a country matron\n",
      "rallied her on being without children, another matron exclaimed, \"She's\n",
      "second mother to half the gals in the county\"--a statement which Grace\n",
      "repeated to Philip in great glee, following it with a demure question\n",
      "as to the advisability of living up to her new dignity by taking to\n",
      "spectacles and sun-bonnets.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in her sober moments, and sometimes in the hurry of business,\n",
      "a spectre of malaria would suddenly intrude upon her thoughts.\n",
      "Occasionally she saw cases of rheumatism, rickets, helpless limbs,\n",
      "twitching faces, and other ailments that caused her heart to ache,\n",
      "and prompted her to ask the cause. The answers were various:\n",
      "\"malary\"--\"fever an' ager\"--\"malarier\"--\"chills\"--\"malaria,\" but the\n",
      "meanings were one. One day she burst in an instant from laughter into\n",
      "tears at seeing a babe, not a year old, shaking violently with a chill.\n",
      "Straightway Grace went to the minister--poor minister!--and demanded\n",
      "to know how the Lord could permit so dreadful an occurrence. One day,\n",
      "after engaging Doctor Taggess in general conversation, she abruptly\n",
      "said, despite Philip's reminder that physicians dislike \"shop talk\":--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you would tell me all about malaria; what it is, and where it\n",
      "comes from, and why we don't get rid of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear woman,\" the Doctor replied, \"ask me about electricity, of\n",
      "which no one knows much, and I can tell you something, but malaria is\n",
      "beyond my ken. I know it when I see it in human nature; that is, I\n",
      "treat almost all diseases as if they were malarial, and I seldom find\n",
      "myself mistaken, but, beyond that, malaria is beyond my comprehension.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Doctor, it must be something, and come from somewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. 'Tis generally admitted that malaria is due to an invisible\n",
      "emanation from the soil, and is probably a product of vegetation in a\n",
      "certain stage of decay. It seems to be latent in soil that has not been\n",
      "exposed to the air for some time,--such as that thrown from cellars\n",
      "and wells in process of excavation,--and all swamps are believed to be\n",
      "malaria breeders; for when the swamp land of a section is drained, the\n",
      "malarial diseases of the vicinity disappear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why aren't all swamps drained?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because the work would be too expensive, in the sections where the\n",
      "swamps are, I suppose. Look at this township, for example: while all\n",
      "the ground is open,--that is, not frozen,--the farmers and other people\n",
      "have all they can do at planting, cultivating, harvesting, etc. Swamp\n",
      "land makes the richest soil, after it has been drained, but who's going\n",
      "to drain his own swamp when he already has more good land than he can\n",
      "cultivate? Some of the farmers work at it, a little at a time, but it\n",
      "is slow work,--discouragingly slow,--besides being frightfully hard and\n",
      "disgustingly dirty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why doesn't the government do it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd come to that, for every woman's a socialist at heart\n",
      "until she learns better. Still, so is every man. Well, governments have\n",
      "no money of their own; all they have is taken from the people, in the\n",
      "form of taxes, and any increase of taxes, especially for jobs as large\n",
      "as swamp drainage in this state, would be too unpopular to be voted.\n",
      "Besides, while it would be of general benefit to the many, it would\n",
      "specially and greatly benefit the owners of the swamp land, which would\n",
      "start a frightful howl. Private enterprise may be depended upon to\n",
      "banish swamps and malaria; but first there must be enough population,\n",
      "and enough increase in the value of land, to justify it. I wish 'twould\n",
      "do so in this county and in my day. 'Twould lessen my income, but\n",
      "'twould greatly increase my happiness, for doctors have hearts. By the\n",
      "way, have you yet heard from Caleb on malaria as a means of grace?\n",
      "There's a chance to learn something about malaria--to hear something\n",
      "about it, at least; for Caleb talks well on his pet subjects. Poor\n",
      "fellow, I wish I could cure his chronic malarial troubles. I've tried\n",
      "everything, and he does enjoy far better health than of old, but the\n",
      "cause of the trouble remains. That man came of tall, broad-shouldered\n",
      "stock on both sides--you wouldn't imagine it, would you, to look at\n",
      "him? He's always been industrious and intelligent; everybody likes him\n",
      "and respects him; but at times it's almost impossible to extract an\n",
      "idea or even a word from him--all on account of malaria. Again, he'll\n",
      "have the clearest, cleverest head in town. Seems strange, doesn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace improved an early opportunity to say to Caleb that perhaps she\n",
      "had done wrong in recovering so quickly from her attack of chills, for\n",
      "she had been told that he regarded malaria as a means of grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, yes, I do--'bout the same way as some other things--air, an'\n",
      "light, an' food, an' money, for instance. Anythin' that helps folks\n",
      "to make the most of their opportunities can be a means of grace; when\n",
      "it isn't, the folks themselves are the trouble. Reckon nobody'll\n",
      "dispute that about good things. But when it comes to things that ain't\n",
      "popular,--like floods, an' light'nin'-strokes, an' malary,--well, folks\n",
      "don't seem to see it in the same light, and they suspect the malary\n",
      "most, 'cause it's far an' away the commonest. I've been laughed at so\n",
      "often for my notions on the subject that I've got hardened to it, an'\n",
      "don't mind standin' it again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Caleb! Please don't say that! You don't believe I would laugh at\n",
      "anything you're earnest about, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't really b'lieve you would, an' I'm much 'bliged to you\n",
      "for it. You see, my idee is this. You remember what's said, in one\n",
      "of the psalms, about they that go down to the sea in ships, and what\n",
      "happens to them when a big wind comes up--how they are at their wit's\n",
      "end, because they're in trouble too big for them to manage, so they\n",
      "have to call unto the Lord?--somethin' that sailors ain't b'lieved\n",
      "to be given to doin' over an' above much, judgin' by their general\n",
      "conversation as set down in books an' newspapers. Well, malary's like\n",
      "the wind, an' the spirit that's compared with it; you can't tell where\n",
      "it's comin' from, or when, or how long it's goin' to stay, or what\n",
      "it'll do before it goes. It puts a man face to face with his Maker, an'\n",
      "just when the man can't put on airs, no matter how hard he tries. I\n",
      "think anythin' that kicks a man into seein' his dependence on heaven is\n",
      "a means of grace, even if the man's too mean to take advantage of it.\n",
      "When a man's shakin' with a chill that's come at him on the sly, as a\n",
      "chill always does, an' finds all his grit an' all the doctor's medicine\n",
      "can't keep him from shakin'--snatches him clean away from his own grip,\n",
      "which is the awfullest feelin' a man can have--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're entirely right about it, Caleb,\" said Grace, with a shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, but 'taint only the shake. It's not knowin' how the thing\n",
      "is goin' to come out, or how helpless it's goin' to make one, or in\n",
      "what way it's goin' to upset all his plans an' calculations--why, it\n",
      "teaches absolute dependence on a higher power, an' 'tisn't only folks\n",
      "that make most fuss 'bout it in church that feels it. After one gets\n",
      "that feelin', he's lots more of a man than he ever was before. I think\n",
      "malary has been the makin' of human nature out West here, an' in some\n",
      "parts of the East too. Why, do you know that almost every one of our\n",
      "greatest Presidents was born or brought up in malary-soaked country?\n",
      "Washington was, I know; for I had chills all over his part of Virginia,\n",

      "\"ALONG about now,\" said Caleb to Philip and Grace one morning in\n",
      "midspring, \"is the easiest time o' year that a merchant ever gets in\n",

      "\"The beauty of flowers, I suppose--and their cheapness,\" Grace replied.\n",

      "says he. 'Literature an' art,' says you. Then Jethro come pretty nigh\n",
      "to bustin' hisself. After you was gone he borried some cyclopeedy\n",
      "volumes from Doc Taggess, an' in odd moments he opened 'em at long\n",
      "pieces that was headed 'Literature' an' 'Art.' I watched him pretty\n",
      "close, to know when he was through, so I could pump him about 'em, for\n",
      "his sake as well as mine; for I've most generally found that a man\n",
      "ain't sure of what he knows till he has to tell it to somebody else.\n",

      "'Dog-goned nonsense!' Like enough he was wrong about it, though, for\n",
      "afterwards I dipped into the same pieces myself, a little bit at a\n",

      "the public library of the little town I was born in, and all the\n",
      "best--never mind the worst--that my fellow-shopgirls used to read,\n",
      "and I know the second-hand bookshops in New York, where many good\n",
      "books may be had at a quarter of their original price; so if a hundred\n",
      "dollars is to be spent, I'll engage to get three or four hundred\n",
      "volumes, instead of two hundred. Meanwhile, don't either of you men\n",
      "breathe a word of Caleb's project, until the books are here; otherwise\n",
      "some other merchant may get ahead of us.\"\n",

      "\"Well, I never saw any signs of it before, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor have you seen them to-day. You'll have to take to eye-glasses,\n",
      "Caleb, if only in justice to me. The only reason I don't wish any one\n",
      "else to start the library is that I think the laborer is worthy of\n",
      "his hire. You were the laborer--that is, you devised the plan,--and I\n",
      "wouldn't for anything have you deprived of your pay, which will consist\n",
      "of your pleasure at seeing your old acquaintances supplied with good\n",
      "reading matter. Honor to whom honor is due. Now do you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb's small gray face grew rosy, albeit a bit sheepish, and to hide\n",
      "it, he tiptoed over to Philip, who was staring into vacancy, apparently\n",
      "in search of something, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I b'lieve I've said before, ain't she a peeler?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm puzzled--that's all, yet 'tis not a little,\" Philip replied. \"I\n",

      "a friend to flatter, says I've done remarkably well, and increased the\n",
      "number of our customers and the profits of the business, yet 'tis never\n",
      "I who devise the new, clever plans by which the increase comes. This\n",
      "matter of the free circulating library is only one of several cases\n",
      "in point; they began months ago, with the use of our piano in church.\n",
      "I don't believe I'd have done them solely with a view to business, but\n",
      "I couldn't have helped seeing that they would have that effect in the\n",
      "end, so I wonder why I, myself, shouldn't have thought of them. Perhaps\n",
      "you can tell me, Caleb; don't be afraid of hurting my feelings, and\n",

      "turn the big concern on a rather dark bit o' sky, somewhere near where\n",
      "the star ought to be, an' they work it 'round, little by little,\n",

      "Mrs. Taggess and Pastor Grateway, all of whom greeted her cordially,\n",
      "and congratulated her on the successful opening of the Somerton Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a cruel proof of the saying that one sows and another reaps,\"\n",
      "she replied; \"but please understand in future that this is not the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Je--ru--salem!\" exclaimed Caleb, \"an' I didn't put a cent into it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You devised it,\" Grace replied. \"'Twas like Columbus making the egg\n",
      "stand on end; any one could do it after being told how.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "About this time some responses, in the forms of half-grown boys and\n",
      "girls on foot, began to arrive from the farming district, and Grace\n",
      "had occasionally to leave the store. As she returned from one of these\n",
      "excursions, Mrs. Taggess took her hands and exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a good time you must have had!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, wife!\" protested the Doctor. \"Is this the place for sarcasm? The\n",
      "poor girl looks tired to death.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nevertheless, Mrs. Taggess is entirely right,\" said Grace. \"It was\n",
      "a good time, indeed. How I wish I could sketch from memory! Still, I\n",
      "shall never forget the expression of some of those faces. What a dear\n",
      "lot of people there are in this town!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurrah!\" shouted the Doctor. \"I was afraid that, coming from the city,\n",
      "you mightn't be able to find it out. I apologize with all my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis high time you did,\" said his wife. \"The idea that a doctor, of\n",
      "all men, shouldn't know that a woman's heart rules her eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the Doctor, affecting a sigh. \"It's dreadful to be a man,\n",
      "and know so much that sometimes an important bit of knowledge gets\n",
      "hidden behind something else at the very time it's most needed. How\n",
      "many books have you remaining, to satisfy the country demand, Mrs.\n",
      "Somerton?\"\n",

      "been forgotten during the congratulations, \"that they will have to be\n",
      "purchased at once, and paid for, by the mere nobody of the concern.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nobody, indeed!\" exclaimed Grace, with a look which caused the\n",
      "Taggesses to exchange delighted pinches, and the minister to say:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think any one need go far to find a proof of the blessed\n",
      "mystery that one and one need make only one, if rightly added.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said the Doctor, \"but at least one-half of the one in\n",
      "question is so tired that it ought to get some rest, which it won't and\n",
      "can't while we visitors stay here to admire and ask questions. Come\n",
      "along, wife; we'll find some better time to talk her and these other\n",
      "good people to death about what they've done. I've only to say that\n",
      "if Brother Grateway doesn't give you his benediction in words, he will\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A contrivance for taking photographs. There are small cheap ones that\n",
      "any amateur can use. Two or three girls in our store in New York had\n",

      "\"You shall see. I want one at once, Phil; order it by the first mail,\n",
      "please, and with all the necessary outfit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your will is law, my dear, but I shall first have to learn where to\n",
      "send the order and exactly what to get.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me attend to it. I can order direct from the store in which I\n",
      "worked; they sold everything of the kind.\"\n",

      "Just then the war broke out, an' I went to it; when I got back I had a\n",

      "I had a message of any sort to give to the world,--for every man\n",
      "occasionally has one, you know,--I should be able to do it in a manner\n",
      "that would command attention. I was fortunate enough to get into a\n",

      "through a steam engine. It 'pears that years ago Jake, who was a Yankee\n",
      "with a knack at anythin' that was mechanical, was picked out by some\n",
      "New Yorkers to go down to Brazil to preserve pineapples on a large\n",
      "scale for the American market: he was to have a big salary and some\n",
      "shares of the company's stock. Part of his outfit was a little steam\n",
      "engine an' b'iler an' two copper kettles as big as the lard kettles\n",
      "in your pork-house. Well, he got to work, with the idee o' makin' his\n",

      "somethin' to do with 'em. He shipped 'em up to a city in Venezuela,\n",
      "where there was plenty of cocoanut oil and potash to be had cheap,\n",

      "But the dust! Grace could remember days when New York was dusty, and\n",
      "any one who has encountered a cloud of city dust knows that it is\n",
      "of a quality compared with which the dust of country roads is the\n",
      "sublimation of purity. Nevertheless, the dust at Claybanks had some\n",
      "eccentric methods of motion. For it to rise in a heavy, sullen cloud\n",
      "whenever a wagon passed through a street was bad enough, especially if\n",
      "the wind were in the direction of the house. Almost daily, however,\n",
      "and many times a day, it was picked up by little whirlwinds that came\n",
      "from no one knew where, and an inverted cone of dust, less than a foot\n",
      "in diameter at the base, but rapidly increasing in width to the height\n",
      "of fifty or more feet, would dash rapidly along a street, or across\n",
      "one, picking up all sorts of small objects in its way--leaves, bits\n",
      "of paper, sometimes even bark and chips. At first Grace thought these\n",
      "whirlwinds quite picturesque, but when one of them dashed across her\n",
      "garden, and broke against the side of the house, and deposited much of\n",
      "itself through the open windows, the lover of the picturesque suddenly\n",
      "began to extemporize window-nettings.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the heat and the dust came a plague of insects and one of\n",
      "reptiles. One day the white sugar on the table seemed strangely\n",
      "iridescent with amber, which on investigation resolved itself into\n",
      "myriads of tiny reddish yellow ants. Caleb, who was appealed to, placed\n",
      "a cup of water under each table leg, which abated the plague, but the\n",
      "cups did not \"compose\" with the table and the rug. Bugs of many kinds\n",
      "visited the house, by way of the windows and doors, until excluded by\n",
      "screens. At times the garden seemed fuller of toads than of plants, and\n",
      "not long afterward Grace was frightened almost daily by snakes. That\n",
      "the reptiles scurried away rapidly, apparently as frightened as she,\n",
      "did not lessen her fear of them. She expressed her feelings to Doctor\n",
      "Taggess, who said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't let them worry you. They're really wonderfully retiring by\n",
      "disposition. This country is alive with them, but in my thirty years of\n",
      "experience I've never been called to a case of snake-bite.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Doctor, isn't there any means of avoiding the torment of--snakes,\n",
      "toads, bugs, and ants?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only one, that I know of--'tis philosophy. Try to think of them as\n",
      "illustrations of the marvellous fecundity of the great and glorious\n",
      "West.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How consoling!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't wonder you're sarcastic about it. Still, they'll disappear in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But when?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, when the country becomes thoroughly subdued and tilled.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Besides the wind, and dust, and insects, and reptiles, there was the\n",
      "sun, for Jethro Somerton had never planted a tree near his house.\n",
      "Tree-roots had a way of weakening foundations, he said; besides,\n",
      "trees would grow tall in the course of time, and perhaps attract the\n",
      "lightning. Still more, trees shaded roofs, so the spring and autumn\n",
      "rains remained in the shingles to cause dampness and decay, instead of\n",
      "drying out quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her own house seemed cool by comparison with some which she entered\n",
      "in the village and in the farming districts: houses such as most new\n",
      "settlers in the West have put up with their own hands and as quickly as\n",
      "possible; houses innocent of lath and plaster, and with only inch-thick\n",
      "wooden walls, upon which the sun beat so fiercely that by midday the\n",
      "inner surface of the wall almost blistered the hand that touched it.\n",
      "Not to have been obliged to enter such houses would have spared Grace\n",
      "much discomfort, but it was the hospitable custom of the country to\n",
      "hail passers-by, in the season of open doors and windows, and Grace,\n",
      "besides being bound by the penalties peculiar to general favorites\n",
      "everywhere, was alive to the fear of being thought \"stuck up\" by any\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quickly she uprooted many delicate, graceful vines which she had\n",
      "planted to train against the sides of her own house, and replaced them\n",
      "with seeds of more rampant varieties. For days she made a single room\n",
      "of the house fairly endurable by keeping in it a large block of ice,\n",
      "brought from the ice-house by Philip in mid-morning; but the season's\n",
      "stock of the ice-house had not been estimated with a view to such\n",
      "drafts, so for the sake of the \"truck\" in cold storage she felt obliged\n",
      "to discontinue the practice. Wet linen sheets hung near the windows\n",
      "and open doors afforded some relief; but when other sufferers heard of\n",
      "them and learned their cost, and ejaculated \"Goodness me!\" or something\n",
      "of similar meaning, Grace was compelled to feel aristocratic and\n",
      "uncomfortable. She expressed to Caleb and to Doctor Taggess her pity\n",
      "for sufferers by the heat, and asked whether nothing could be done in\n",
      "alleviation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear woman, they don't suffer as much as you imagine,\" the Doctor\n",
      "replied. \"In the first place, they are accustomed to the climate, as\n",
      "you are not; most of them were born in it. Another cooling fact is\n",
      "that neither men nor women wear as much clothing in hot weather as you\n",
      "Eastern people. They, or most of them, are always hard at work, and\n",
      "therefore always perspiring, which is nature's method of keeping people\n",
      "fairly comfortable in hot weather. I don't doubt that I suffer far more\n",
      "as I drive about the county, doing no harder work than holding the\n",
      "reins, than any farmer whom I see ploughing in the fields.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very glad to hear it, for their sakes, though not for your own.\n",
      "But how about the sick, and the poor little babies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, this is a sad country for sick folks, and for weaklings of any\n",
      "kind. Stifle in winter--roast in summer; that is about the usual way.\n",
      "Imagine, if you can, how an honest physician feels when he's called to\n",
      "cases of sickness in some houses that you've seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb,\" Grace said, \"was it as hot in the South, during the war, as it\n",
      "is out here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Caleb, promptly, \"though the Eastern men complained a great\n",
      "deal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did the soldiers do when they became sick in hot weather?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They died, generally, unless they was shipped up North, or to some of\n",
      "the big camps of hospitals, where they could get special attention.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But until then were there no ways of shielding them from the heat of\n",
      "the sun?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. If the camp hospital was a tent, it had a fly--an extra\n",
      "thickness of canvas, stretched across it to shade the roof an' sides.\n",
      "Then, if any woods was near by, and usually there was,--there's more\n",
      "woodland in old Virginia than in this new state,--some forked sticks\n",
      "an' poles an' leafy tree-boughs would be fetched in, an' fixed so that\n",
      "the ground for eight or ten feet around would be shady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you remember just how it was done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do I? Well, I reckon I was on details at that sort o' work about as\n",
      "often as anybody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you do me a great favor? Hire a man and wagon to-morrow--or\n",
      "to-day, if there's time--and go to some of our woodland near town, and\n",
      "get some of the material, and put up such a shade on the south and west\n",
      "sides of our house; that is, if you don't object.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Object? 'Twould be great fun; make me feel like a boy again, I reckon.\n",
      "But I ought to remind you that the thing won't look a bit pretty, two\n",
      "or three days later, when the leaves begin to fade. Dead leaves an'\n",
      "a white house don't 'compose,' as I heard you say one day to a woman\n",
      "about two calicoes that was contrary to each other. Besides, 'tain't\n",
      "necessary, for double-width sheetin', or two widths of it side by side,\n",
      "an' right out of the store here, would make a better awnin', to say\n",
      "nothin' o' the looks, an' you can afford it easy enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, but there are other people who can't, and I want to show off\n",
      "a tree-bough awning to some who need contrivances like it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I--see,\" said Caleb, departing abruptly, while Doctor Taggess\n",
      "exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And here I've been practising in some of those bake-ovens of houses\n",
      "for thirty years, and never thought of that very simple means of\n",
      "relief! Good day, Mrs. Somerton; I'll go home and tell my wife what\n",
      "I've heard, then I think I'll read some of the penitential Psalms and\n",
      "some choice bits of Proverbs on the mental peculiarities of fools.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The arbor was completed by dark, and on the next day, and for a\n",
      "fortnight afterward, almost every woman who entered the store was\n",
      "invited to step into the garden and see how well, and yet cheaply,\n",
      "the house was shaded from the sun. All were delighted, though some\n",
      "warned the owner that the shade would kill her vines, whereupon Doctor\n",
      "Taggess, who spent parts of several hours in studying the structure,\n",
      "suggested that if the probable copyists were to set their posts and\n",
      "frameworks securely, they might serve as support for quick-growing\n",
      "hardy vines that might be \"set\" in the spring of the following year,\n",
      "and clamber all over the skeleton roof before the hottest days came.\n",
      "Thereupon Grace volunteered to write a lot of nursery men to learn what\n",
      "vines, annual or perennial, grew most rapidly and cost least, and to\n",
      "leave the replies in the store for general inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doctor,\" Grace asked during one of the physician's visits of\n",
      "inspection, \"where did the settlers of this country come from, that\n",
      "they never think of certain of their own necessities? Don't scold me,\n",
      "please; I'm not going to abuse your darling West; besides, 'tis my\n",
      "West as well as yours, for every interest I have is here. But Eastern\n",
      "farmers and villagers plant shade trees and vines near their houses,\n",
      "unless they can afford to build piazzas,--and perhaps in addition to\n",
      "piazzas. They shade their village streets, too, and many of their\n",
      "highways. Aren't such things the custom in other parts of the United\n",
      "States?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They certainly are in my native state, which is Pennsylvania,\" the\n",
      "Doctor replied, \"and some of the handsomest villages and farm-houses\n",
      "I've seen are in Ohio and Kentucky. But I imagine the work was done by\n",
      "the second or third or fourth generation; I don't believe the original\n",
      "settlers could find the time and strength for such effort. As to our\n",
      "people, they came from a dozen or more states--East, West, and Middle,\n",
      "with a few from the South. I honestly believe they're quite as good as\n",
      "the average of settlers of any state, but I shouldn't wonder if you've\n",
      "failed to comprehend at short acquaintance the settler or the farmer\n",
      "class in general. In a new country one usually finds only people who've\n",
      "been elbowed out of older ones, either by misfortune or bad management,\n",
      "or through families having become too large to get a living out of\n",
      "their old homesteads, and with no land near by that was within reach\n",
      "of their pockets. There are as many causes in farming as in any other\n",
      "business for men trying to make a start somewhere else, but a starter\n",
      "in the farming line is always very poor. Almost any family you might\n",
      "name in this county brought itself and all its goods and implements\n",
      "in a single two-horse wagon. Your things, Caleb told me, filled the\n",
      "greater part of a railway car. Quite a difference, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yet most of the things were ours, when we thought ourselves very poor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so. So you can't imagine the poverty of these people. They lived\n",
      "in their wagons until they had some sort of roof over their heads;\n",
      "a man who could spend a hundred dollars for lumber and nails and\n",
      "window-sash passed for one of the well-to-do class. Some of them had no\n",
      "money whatever; their nearest neighbors would help them put up a log\n",
      "house, but afterward they had to work pretty hard to keep the wolf from\n",
      "the door until they could grow something to eat and to sell. They had\n",
      "hard times, of so many varieties, that now when they are sure of three\n",
      "meals a day, some cows, pigs, and chickens, credit at a store, and a\n",
      "crop in the ground, they think themselves well off, no matter how many\n",
      "discomforts they may have to endure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Doctor, they're human; they have hearts and feelings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but they have more endurance than anything else. It has become\n",
      "second nature to them; so some of them would long endure a pain or\n",
      "discomfort rather than relieve it. Doubt it, if you like, but I am\n",
      "speaking from a great mass of experience. I've heard much of the\n",
      "endurance of the North American Indian, but the Indian is a baby to\n",
      "these farmer-settlers. Endurance is in their every muscle, bone, and\n",
      "nerve, and they pass it down to their children. Eastern babies would\n",
      "scream unceasingly at maladies that some of our youngsters bear without\n",
      "a whimper. Many of the Presidents of the United States were born of\n",
      "just such stock; of course they were examples of the survival of the\n",
      "fittest, for any who are weak in such a country must go to the wall in\n",
      "a hurry, if they chance to escape the grave--and the graveyards are\n",
      "appallingly full.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And 'tis the women and children that fill them!\" Grace said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" assented the Doctor. \"If I could have my way, no women and\n",
      "children would be allowed in a new section until the men had made\n",
      "decent, comfortable homes, with crops ready for harvest, all of which\n",
      "shows what an impracticable old fool a man of experience may become.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But a little work, by the men of some of these places, would make the\n",
      "women and children so much more comfortable!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but the women and children don't think to ask it, and the men\n",
      "don't notice the deficiency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why shouldn't they? Many men elsewhere are perpetually contriving\n",
      "to make their families more comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but seldom unless the necessity of doing so is forced to\n",
      "their attention in some way. Besides, to do so, they must have the\n",
      "contriving, inventive faculty, which is one of the scarcest in human\n",
      "nature!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Doctor! I've often heard that we Americans are the most inventive\n",
      "people in the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we are, according to the Patent Office reports, though the patents\n",
      "don't average one to a hundred people, and not more than one in ten of\n",
      "them is worth developing. I am right in saying that invention--except,\n",
      "perhaps, of lies--is among the rarest of human qualities. It requires\n",
      "quick perception and a knack at construction, as well as no end of\n",
      "adaptiveness and energy, all of which are themselves rare qualities.\n",
      "Countless generations ached seven or eight hours of every twenty-four,\n",
      "until a few years ago, when some one invented springy bottoms for beds.\n",
      "Countless generations of men had to cut four times as much wood as\n",
      "now, and innumerable women smoked their eyes out, cooking over open\n",
      "fires, before any one thought of making stoves of stone or of iron\n",
      "plates. Almost every labor-saving contrivance you've seen might have\n",
      "been perfected before it was, if the inventive faculty hadn't been so\n",
      "rare. Why, half of the newest contrivances of the day are so simple and\n",
      "obvious, that smart men, when they see them, want to shoot themselves\n",
      "for not having themselves invented them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, to come back to what we were talking of--the prospect of country\n",
      "women and children being made more comfortable is extremely dismal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not necessarily; country people have their special virtues, though\n",
      "many of them have about as little inventive capacity as so many cows.\n",
      "Still, they're great as copyists. For instance, my wife told me that\n",
      "every girl in the county wanted a dress exactly like one you made of\n",
      "two bits of dead-stock calico. They're already copying, I'm glad to\n",
      "say, your brushwood shade for the sides of the house. So, if you'll go\n",
      "right on inventing--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I didn't invent the brushwood shade; you yourself heard Caleb tell\n",
      "me of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, after you'd dragged it out of his memory, where it had been\n",
      "doing nothing for almost a quarter of a century.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure I didn't design the combination of calicoes; the idea was far\n",
      "older than the calicoes themselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps, but you adapted it, as you did Caleb's army hospital shade.\n",
      "Don't ever forget that most so-called inventors, including the very\n",
      "greatest, are principally adapters. 'Tis plain to see that you have the\n",
      "faculty, so don't waste any time in pitying those who haven't; just go\n",
      "on, perceiving and inventing--or adapting, if you prefer to call it so.\n",
      "Try it on everything, from clothes and cookery to religion, and you may\n",
      "depend on most of the people hereabouts to copy you to the full measure\n",
      "of their ability. There! I don't think you'll want to hear the sound of\n",
      "my voice again in a month. Caleb isn't the only man who finds it hard\n",

      "XIV--FUN WITH A CAMERA\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FOR some days after Grace's camera arrived there were many customers\n",
      "and commercial travellers who had to wait for hours to see the one\n",
      "person with whom they preferred to transact business in the store, for\n",
      "a camera is procrastination's most formidable rival in the character\n",
      "of a thief of time. Grace made \"snap-shots\" at almost everything, and\n",
      "John Henry Bustpodder, the most enterprising of Philip's competitors,\n",
      "took great satisfaction in disseminating the statement that he reckoned\n",
      "the new store-keeper's wife was running to seed, for she'd been seen\n",
      "chasing a whirlwind and trying to shoot it with a black box.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Somerton customers regarded the general subject from a\n",
      "different standpoint, for Grace surprised some of them with pictures\n",
      "taken, without their knowledge, of themselves in their wagons, or in\n",
      "front of their houses, or on the way to church. They were not of high\n",
      "quality; but as the best the natives had previously seen were some\n",
      "dreadful tintypes perpetrated annually by a man who frequented county\n",
      "fairs, they were doubly satisfactory, for she would not accept pay\n",
      "for them. She surprised herself, also, sometimes beyond expression,\n",
      "by some of her failures, which were quite as dreadful as anything she\n",
      "had dreamed after almost stepping on snakes--people without heads, or\n",
      "with hands larger than their bodies, or with other faces superimposed\n",
      "upon their own. She also made the full quantity and variety of other\n",
      "blunders peculiar to amateurs, and she stained her finger-tips so\n",
      "deeply that Philip pretended to suspect her of the cigarette habit; but\n",
      "she persisted until she succeeded in getting some pictures which she\n",
      "was not ashamed to send to her aunt and to some of her acquaintances in\n",
      "the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb, who endeavored to master everything mechanical and technical\n",
      "that came within his view, took so great interest in the camera, even\n",
      "begging permission to see the developing process, that Philip one day\n",
      "said to him:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb, if your interest in that plaything continues, I shan't\n",
      "be surprised if some day I hear you advance the theory that even\n",
      "photography is a means of grace,\" and Caleb cheerily replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like enough, for anythin's a means o' grace, if you know how to use it\n",
      "right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even snakes?\" Grace asked, with a smile that was checked by a shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course. The principal use o' snakes, so far as I can see, is to\n",
      "scare lots o' people almost to death, once in a while, an' a good scare\n",
      "is the only way o' makin' some people see the error o' their ways.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm!\" said Philip. \"That's rather rough on my wife, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Caleb. \"Some folks--mentionin' no names, an' hopin'\n",
      "no offence'll be took, as I once read somewhere--some folks are so\n",
      "all-fired nice, an' good, an' lucky, an' pretty much everythin' else\n",
      "that's right, that I do believe they need to be scared 'most to death\n",
      "once in a while, just to remind 'em how much they've got to be thankful\n",
      "for, an' how sweet it is to live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace blushed, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Caleb; but if you're right, I'm afraid I'm doomed to see\n",
      "snakes frequently for the remainder of my natural life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speakin' o' snakes as a means o' grace,\" said Caleb, \"p'r'aps 'twould\n",
      "int'rest you to know that some awful drunkards in this county was\n",
      "converted by snakes. Yes'm; snakes in their boots scared them drunkards\n",
      "into the kingdom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In--their--boots?\" murmured Grace, with a wild stare. \"How utterly\n",
      "dreadful! I didn't suppose that the crawling things--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your education in idioms hasn't been completed, my dear,\" said Philip.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll do it--as soon as I can find out. I'm askin' the question myself,\n",
      "just now, an' I reckon I'll find the answer before I stop tryin'. There\n",
      "don't seem to be anythin' about your camera that'll spile, an' I've\n",
      "read that book o' instructions through an' through, till I've got it\n",
      "'most by heart. Would you mind lettin' me try to make a pictur' or two\n",
      "some day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least. You're welcome to the camera and outfit at almost\n",
      "any time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Grace continued to \"have lots of fun\" with the camera. She\n",
      "resolved to have a portrait collection of all the babies in the town;\n",
      "and as she promised prints to the mothers of the subjects, she had\n",
      "no difficulty in obtaining \"sittings.\" To the great delight of the\n",
      "mothers, the pictures were usually far prettier than the babies, for\n",
      "Grace smiled and gesticulated and chirruped at the infants until she\n",
      "cajoled some expression into little faces usually blank. Incidentally\n",
      "she got some mother pictures that impressed her deeply and made her\n",
      "serious and thoughtful for hours at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her greatest success, however, according to the verdict of the people,\n",
      "was a print with which she dashed into the store one day, exclaiming to\n",
      "her husband and Caleb:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do look at this! I exposed the plate one Sunday morning, weeks ago,\n",
      "and then mislaid the holder, so that I didn't find it until to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a picture of the front of the church, taken a few moments before\n",
      "service began--the moments, dear to country congregations, in which\n",
      "the people, too decorous to whisper in church, yet longing to chat\n",
      "with acquaintances whom they had not met in days or weeks, gathered in\n",
      "little groups outside the building. The light had been exactly right;\n",
      "also the distance and the focus, and the people so well distributed\n",
      "that the picture was almost as effective as if its material had been\n",
      "arranged and \"composed\" by an artist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je--ru--salem!\" exclaimed Caleb. \"Why, the people ain't much bigger\n",
      "than tacks, an' yet I can pick out ev'ry one of 'em by name. Well,\n",
      "well!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the print to the door and studied it more closely. When he\n",
      "returned with it, he continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a great pictur'. It ought to have a name.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm!\" said Philip, winking at his wife, \"how would this do: 'Not\n",
      "exactly a means of grace, but within fifteen minutes of it'--eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a mighty sight nigher than that,\" said Caleb, solemnly, \"besides\n",
      "bein' the best 'throw-in' that's come to light yet. Give copies of\n",
      "that away to customers that don't ever go to church, an' they'll\n",
      "begin to go, hopin' they'll stand a chance o' bein' took in the next;\n",
      "an' if they get under the droppin's of the sanctuary, why, Brother\n",
      "Grateway an' the rest of us'll try to do the rest. Grateway needs some\n",
      "encouragement o' that kind, for he's sort o' down in the mouth about\n",
      "nothin' comin' of his efforts with certain folks in this town. He's\n",
      "dropped warnin's and exhortations on 'em, in season an' out o' season,\n",
      "for quite a spell, but he was tellin' me only yesterday that it seemed\n",
      "like the seed in the parable, that was sowed on stony ground. An'\n",
      "say--Je--ru--salem!--when did you say you took that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Two or three weeks ago,\" Grace replied.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not until to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An' the pictur' has been on the plate all that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In one way, yes. That is, the plate had been exposed at the subjects,\n",
      "and they had been impressed upon it by the light, although it still\n",
      "looked plain and blank, until the developing fluid was poured upon it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long would it stay so, an' yet be fit to be developed?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, years, I suppose. Travellers in Africa and elsewhere have carried\n",
      "such plates, and exposed them, and not developed them until they\n",
      "returned to civilization, perhaps a year or two later.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to know! Got any other plate as old as the one this pictur' was\n",
      "made from?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, one; it was in the other side of the same holder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you mind developin' it to-night, in your kitchen, before\n",
      "company? Nobody that's fussy--only Brother Grateway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know I'll do anything to oblige you and him, Caleb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hooray! Excuse me, please, while I go off an' make sure o' his comin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you suppose is on Caleb's mind now?\" Grace asked, as Caleb and\n",
      "the picture disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I give it up,\" Philip replied, \"though I shan't be surprised if 'tis\n",
      "something relative to a camera being a means of grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't imagine how.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not, but let's await--literally speaking--developments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll be here,\" said Caleb, a few moments later; he looked gleeful as\n",
      "he said it, and shuffled his feet in a manner so suggestive of dancing\n",
      "that Grace pretended to be shocked, at which Caleb reddened. During the\n",
      "remainder of the afternoon he looked as happy as if he had collected\n",
      "a long-deferred bill, or given the dreaded \"malary\" a new repulse. He\n",
      "hurried Philip and Grace home to supper, so that the kitchen might\n",
      "sooner be free for photographic purposes, and dusk had scarcely lost\n",
      "itself in darkness when he closed the store and appeared at the house\n",
      "with Pastor Grateway, who expressed himself exuberantly concerning the\n",
      "picture of his church and congregation; but Caleb cut him short by\n",
      "saying:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ev'rythin' ready, Mis' Somerton? Good! Come along, Brother\n",
      "Grateway--you, too, Philip.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the trays and chemicals were being arranged, Caleb explained\n",
      "to the pastor that photographs were first taken on glass plates,\n",
      "chemically treated, and that the picture proper was made by light\n",
      "passing through a plate to the surface of sensitized paper. When the\n",
      "red lamp was lighted, Caleb continued:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, when Mis' Somerton lays a plate in that tray, you'll see it's\n",
      "as blank as a sheet o' paper, or as the faces o' some o' the ungodly\n",
      "that you've been preachin' at an' laborin' with, year in and year out.\n",
      "You can't see nothin' on it, no matter if you use a hundred-power\n",
      "magnifyin' glass. But the pictur' 's there all the same; it was took\n",
      "weeks ago; might ha' been months or years, but it's there, an' yet the\n",
      "thing goes on lookin' blank till the developer is poured on it--just\n",
      "like Mis' Somerton's doin' now. Now keep your eye on it. It don't\n",
      "seem to mind, at first--goes on lookin' as blank as the faces o'\n",
      "case-hardened sinners at a revival meetin'. But bimeby--pretty soon--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See those spots!\" exclaimed the minister. \"Eh? Why, to be sure. Well,\n",
      "a photograph plate is a good deal like measles an' religion--it first\n",
      "breaks out in spots. But keep on lookin'--see it come!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wonderful! Wonderful!\" exclaimed the minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seemed miraculous to me, first time I see it,\" said Caleb. \"I'd have\n",
      "been skeered if Mis' Somerton hadn't said 'twas all right, for no magic\n",
      "stories I ever read held a candle to it. But keep on lookin'. See one\n",
      "thing comin' after another, an' all of 'em comin' plainer an' stronger\n",
      "ev'ry minute? Could you 'a' b'lieved it, if you hadn't seen it with\n",
      "your own eyes? An' even now you've seen it, don't it 'pear 'bout as\n",
      "mysterious as the ways o' Providence? I've read all Mis' Somerton's\n",
      "book tells about it, an' a lot more in the cyclopeedy, but it ain't no\n",
      "less wonderful than it was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Absolutely marvellous!\" replied the minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what it is. Now, Brother Grateway, that plate was just like\n",
      "the people you was tellin' me 'bout yesterday, that you was clean\n",
      "discouraged over. You've been pilin' warnin's an' exhortations on 'em,\n",
      "an' they didn't seem to mind 'em worth a cent--'peared just as blank\n",
      "as they ever were. But the pictur' was there, an' there 'twas boun'\n",
      "to stay, as long as the plate lasted--locked up in them chemicals,\n",
      "to be sure, but there it was all the same, an' out it came when the\n",
      "developer was poured on an' soaked in. An' so, John Grateway, all that\n",
      "you've ever put into them people is there, somewhere--heaven only\n",
      "knows where an' how, for human natur' 's a mighty sight queerer than\n",
      "a photograph plate, an' to bring out what's in it takes about as many\n",
      "kinds o' developer as there are people. Mebbe you haven't got the right\n",
      "developer, but it's somewhere, waitin' for its time--mebbe it'll be\n",
      "a big scare, or a dyin' wife, or a mother's trouble. Religious talk\n",
      "rolled off o' me for years, like water from a duck's back, till one\n",
      "day I fell between two saw-logs in the crick, an' thought 'twas all up\n",
      "with me--that was the developer I needed. So when you say your prayers\n",
      "to-night, don't forget to give thanks for havin' seen a photograph\n",
      "plate developed, an' after this you go right on takin' pictur's, so to\n",
      "speak, with all your might, an' when you find you can't finish them,\n",
      "hearten yourself up by rememberin' that there's Somebody that knows\n",
      "millions of times as much about the developin' business as you do, an'\n",
      "gives His entire time an' attention to it.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Caleb. \"Heapin' coals o' fire on a man's head, accordin' to\n",

      "does the other feller some good, besides takin' a lot o' the devil\n",
      "out o' yours truly. But about bathin'--well, I learned the good of\n",
      "it when I was a hospital nurse for a spell in the army, an' I've been\n",
      "pretty particular 'bout it ever since, though my bath-tub's only an\n",
      "army rubber blanket with four slats under the edges, to keep the water\n",
      "from gettin' away. I've talked cleanliness a good deal for years, an'\n",
      "told folks that there wa'n't no patent on my kind o' bath-tub; but it\n",

      "\"Don't be too sure o' that. Besides, I'm dead certain that bathin's a\n",
      "means o' grace. Doc Taggess says so, too, an' he ought to know, from\n",
      "his knowledge o' one side o' human nature. He knows a powerful lot\n",
      "about the other side, too, for what Taggess don't know about the human\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Been thinkin' over it off an' on, ever since your contraption was put\n",
      "in. You see, it's this way. I own a little house that I lent money on\n",
      "from time to time, till the owner died an' I had to take it in--the\n",
      "mortgages got to be bigger than the house was worth. It's framed\n",
      "heavy enough for a barn, so the upstairs floor'll be strong enough\n",
      "to hold a mighty big tank o' water, an' the well is one o' the deep\n",
      "never-failin' kind. Black Sam, the barber, used to be body-servant to\n",
      "a man down South, an' knows how to give baths--I've had him take care\n",
      "o' me sometimes, when the malary stiffened my j'ints so I couldn't use\n",
      "my arms much. Well, Sam's to have the house, rent free, an' move his\n",
      "barber shop into it. He don't get more'n an hour or two o' work a day,\n",
      "so he'll have plenty o' time to 'tend to bath-house customers that\n",

      "the upstairs part of that house, right under the roof, is about as hot,\n",
      "'pears to me, as the last home o' the wicked, so if the tank's filled\n",

      "Philip told Grace of Caleb's new project, and Grace was astonished and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Some of the New York baths have women's days, or women's hours. I\n",

      "\n",

      "rent, and you pay him three hundred dollars a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That isn't all his income,\" Philip replied, \"for he gets once in\n",
      "three months a pension check of pleasing size. Still, you would be\n",
      "astonished to know how little cash he draws on account, and how great\n",
      "a quantity of goods is charged to him from month to month. I've been\n",
      "curious enough about it, at times, to trace the items from the ledger\n",
      "back to the day-book, and I learned that his account for groceries,\n",
      "food-stuffs generally, and dry goods is far larger than our own. As for\n",
      "patent medicines, he seems to consume them by the gallon--perhaps with\n",
      "the hope of curing his malaria. I've sometimes been at the point of\n",
      "asking him what he does with all of it; if he weren't so transparently,\n",
      "undoubtedly honest, I should imagine that he was doing a snug little\n",
      "private business on his own account; for, as you know, he pays only\n",
      "original cost price for what he buys.\"\n",

      "know what his right hand is doing. And oh, Phil, long as we've been\n",
      "here,--almost half a year,--we've never done any charitable work\n",
      "whatever.\"\n",

      "events fall upon a single day, but on May 30, 188-, Claybanks and\n",
      "vicinity palpitated from centre to circumference over the celebration\n",
      "of Decoration Day and the opening of the Claybanks Bath-house. The\n",
      "public buildings did not close; neither did the stores, for the entire\n",
      "community flocked to the town, and the stores were the only possible\n",
      "lounging-places. Grace had learned, to her great regret, which was\n",
      "shared by Caleb, that the local Grand Army post never paraded in\n",
      "uniform, for the reason that the members found it too hard to supply\n",
      "themselves with sufficient clothing, for every day and Sunday use, to\n",
      "afford a suit to be worn only a single day of the year, and she had\n",
      "told Caleb that it was a shame that the government did not supply its\n",
      "old soldiers with uniforms in which to celebrate their one great day,\n",
      "and Caleb had replied that perhaps if it did, the Southerner Ojam, who\n",
      "had charged with Pickett at Gettysburg, and who always marched with the\n",
      "\"boys\" to decorate the graves, might feel ruled out, and then Grace had\n",
      "unburdened her heart to Philip, and given him so little peace about it\n",
      "that finally he became so interested in the Grand Army of the Republic\n",
      "that he studied all the local members as intently as if he were looking\n",
      "for a long-lost brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the sun of Decoration Day arose, the centre of interest was\n",
      "the bath-house. The veterans who had been selected for the opening\n",
      "ceremonies approached the place as tremblingly as a lot of penitents\n",
      "for public baptism; some of them were so appalled at the prospect that\n",
      "they approached the house by devious ways, even by sneaking through\n",
      "various back yards and climbing fences. Caleb himself was somewhat\n",
      "mystified by a request from Black Sam that he would remain out of\n",
      "sight until the ordeal had ended; and as the store filled early with\n",
      "customers, and Philip was obliged to be absent for an hour or two,\n",
      "Caleb was compelled to comply with the request, after sending word\n",
      "to the non-drinking members to keep the others from the vicinity of\n",
      "Bustpodder's store and all other places where liquor was sold. The\n",
      "caution did not seem to be necessary, however; for not a man emerged\n",
      "from the bath-house to answer the questions of the multitude that was\n",
      "consuming with curiosity, and from which arose from time to time sundry\n",
      "cheers and jeers that must have been exasperating in the extreme.\n",
      "\n",

      "No, nothing wrong; but go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Business went on, and Grace did her best to attend to a score of\n",
      "feminine customers at one and the same time; but suddenly the entire\n",
      "crowd hurried out of the store, for the sound of the G. A. R.'s fife\n",
      "and drum, playing \"We'll Rally Round the Flag,\" floated through the\n",

      "\"Oh, Phil!\" exclaimed Grace, looking up the street, \"they have guns,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"True, but Caleb is a great man to bring new things to pass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're all in uniform but three,\" said Grace, as the little\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The fifer and drummer were not soldiers. The man with the flag is\n",

      "\n",
      "So he was, even to a gray hat, with the Stars and Bars on its front,\n",
      "and a long gray plume at its side, and the magnificent Southern swagger\n",
      "with which he bore the colors was--after the flag itself--the grandest\n",
      "feature of the procession. The multitude on both sides of the street\n",
      "applauded wildly, but the old soldiers marched as steadily as if they\n",
      "were on duty, for the uniforms and muskets were recalling old times in\n",
      "their fulness. Suddenly, as the procession reached the front of the\n",
      "store, Post-Commander Caleb Wright, sword in hand, shouted:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Halt! Front! Right--dress! Front! Present--arms!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To the front came the muskets, Caleb's sword-hilt was raised to his\n",

      "uniforms!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eighteen slouch hats waved in the air, an eighteen-soldier-power roar\n",
      "arose, the fife shrieked three times, the drummer rolled three ruffles.\n",
      "Then One-Arm Ojam, the flag rested against his armless shoulder, waved\n",
      "his gray hat picturesquely, and roared:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three cheers for the giver of the uniforms!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a second round of cheering ended, a man in the ranks shouted\n",
      "\"Speech!\" and the word was echoed by several others. Then Philip, while\n",
      "his wife's lips became shapeless in wide-mouthed wonder, removed his\n",
      "hat and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fellow-Americans, the uniforms weren't a gift. They're merely a\n",
      "partial payment, on my own account, for what you did for mine and me\n",
      "when I was very young. This is one of the proudest days of my life;\n",
      "for though I took the measure of each of you by guess-work, no man's\n",
      "clothes seem a very bad fit.\" Then he returned abruptly into the store,\n",
      "followed by his wife, who exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You splendid, dreadful fellow! You were letting me believe that Caleb\n",
      "did it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So he did, my dear. 'Twas your telling me the story of Caleb's pension\n",

      "of how little consideration they get. Besides, I'm always wishing to do\n",
      "something special to please Caleb, and this was the first chance I'd\n",
      "seen in a long time. His fear of One-Arm Ojam being estranged if the\n",
      "Post got into uniform troubled me for a day or two, but I seem to have\n",
      "taken Ojam's measure--in both senses--quite well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Grace began to laugh, and continued until she became almost\n",
      "helpless, Philip meanwhile looking as if he wondered what he had said\n",
      "that could have been so amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If your Uncle Jethro could have been here!\" she said as soon as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",

      "business while I was planning it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That isn't what I meant,\" Grace said. \"I was thinking of your uncle's\n",
      "disgust when he learned that one of your reasons for wishing to live\n",
      "in New York was that you might study art. Your studies never went\n",
      "far beyond sketching the human figure, poor boy; but if he were here\n",
      "to-day, and you were to tell him that your art studies, such as they\n",
      "were, had enabled you to guess correctly the proportions of eighteen\n",
      "suits of men's clothes, imagine his astonishment--if you can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the laughter was resumed, and Philip assisted at it, until Caleb\n",
      "entered the store and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been comparin' notes,--the boys an' me, an' we've agreed that it\n",
      "beat any surprises we had in the war; for there, we always knowed, the\n",
      "surprises was layin' in wait for us a good deal of the time. How you\n",
      "managed it beats me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil, didn't even Caleb know what was going on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not until he left the store about half an hour ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you splendid, smart--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Spare my blushes, dear girl. As to the things, Caleb, I had them\n",
      "addressed to Black Sam, whom I let into the secret, and I had them\n",
      "wagoned at night from the railway to the bath-house, where he unpacked\n",
      "them and hid them in one of his rooms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want to know! But what put you up to thinkin' o' doin' the greatest\n",
      "thing that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twas a story my wife told me, about the way you dispose of your\n",
      "pension. 'Twas all of your own doing, after all, you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb looked sheepish, said something about the \"boys\" becoming uneasy\n",
      "unless the march was resumed, and made haste to rejoin his command, but\n",
      "stopped halfway to the door, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mebbe 'tain't any o' my business, but as I'm Commander of the Post,\n",
      "an' yet you've been managin' it most o' the mornin', an' I hadn't time\n",
      "to ask the why an' wherefore o' things,--how did you get Ojam to carry\n",
      "our flag?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I dared him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An' he, bein' a Southerner, wouldn't take a dare?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, it needed no dare. He said he'd been longing for such\n",
      "a chance for many years; for you'd reminded him one day that he was an\n",
      "American, and that plain American was good enough for you. 'Twas a case\n",
      "exactly like that of the uniforms, Caleb; 'twas you that did it--not I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Caleb looked sheepish, and this time he succeeded in rejoining\n",
      "his command and marching it toward the cemetery, followed by the entire\n",
      "populace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We may as well go, too,\" said Philip, closing the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But not empty-handed,\" Grace said, snatching a basket from a hook and\n",
      "hurrying into her garden, where she quickly cut everything that showed\n",
      "any color or bloom, saying as she did so:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps they don't use flowers here, but 'twill do no harm to offer\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get out the horse and buggy; that basket will be very heavy,\"\n",
      "said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not as heavy as the veterans' guns--and some widow's memories,\" Grace\n",
      "replied; \"so let us walk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Together they hurried along the dusty road and joined the irregular\n",
      "procession of civilians that followed the veterans. The Claybanks\n",
      "\"God's acre\" bore no resemblance to the park-like cemeteries which\n",
      "Grace had seen near New York, nor did it display any trace of the\n",
      "neatness which marked the little enclosure in which rested the dead of\n",
      "Grace's native village. A man with a scythe had been sent in on the\n",
      "previous day, to make the few soldiers' graves approachable; but weeds\n",
      "and brambles were still abundant near the fence, and Grace shuddered\n",
      "when she saw that most of the graves were marked only by lettered\n",
      "boards instead of stones, and that tiny graves were numerous. Evidently\n",
      "Claybanks was a dangerous place for infants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon she saw that the usefulness of flowers on Decoration Day was not\n",
      "unknown at Claybanks, and, as the \"Ritual of the Dead\" had already been\n",
      "read and as the veterans were informally passing from grave to grave,\n",
      "she made her way to Caleb, and said reproachfully:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you ask me for some flowers?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I 'lowed that I would,\" Caleb replied, looking at Grace's basket,\n",
      "\"but Mis' Taggess came to me, an' says she, 'Don't you do it, or\n",
      "she'll cut everything in sight,' an' from the looks o' things I reckon\n",
      "that's just what you've done. It's a pity, too, for we hain't got many\n",
      "soldier-dead, an' their graves is pretty well covered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the paht of the Saouth that I come from,\" ventured One-Arm Ojam,\n",
      "\"ev'rybody's graves has flowers put on 'em on Memorial Day, an' the\n",
      "women an' children do most of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You Grand Army men won't feel hurt if the custom is started here, will\n",
      "you?\" Grace asked of Caleb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not us!\" was the reply; so Grace begged the women and children to\n",
      "assist her, and within a few moments every grave in the cemetery had a\n",
      "bit of bloom upon it, and the women had informally resolved that the\n",
      "custom should be followed thereafter on Decoration Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Grand Army Post was called to order, and marched back to the\n",
      "town, led by the fifer and drummer and followed by the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that all?\" Grace asked, when the store had been reopened, and Caleb\n",
      "entered, unclasped his sword-belt, and gazed affectionately at the\n",
      "sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All of the day's ceremonies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In one way, yes, but we vets have a sort o' camp-fire; we get together\n",
      "in my room, after dark, an' swap yarns, an' sing songs, an' have\n",
      "somethin' to eat an' drink, an' manage to have a jolly good time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you'll leave the windows open while you sing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll have to all the time, I reckon, the weather bein' as hot as\n",
      "'tis, but I know the boys'll be pleased to hear that you asked it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, wouldn't I like to be a mouse in the corner to-night!\" Grace said\n",
      "after she had laid away the very last of the supper dishes and dropped\n",
      "into a hammock-chair on the coolest side of the house. \"A mouse in the\n",
      "corner, and hear the war-stories those veterans will tell! They looked\n",
      "so unlike themselves to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possibly because of Caleb's bath-house,\" Philip suggested, \"although\n",
      "I don't doubt that Caleb would be gracious enough to hint that the new\n",
      "uniforms also had some transforming effect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you suppose they will have to eat and drink in Caleb's room?\n",
      "I wish I dared make something nice and send it in. Let me see; we've\n",
      "a lot of the potted meats and fancy biscuits and other things that\n",
      "I ordered from the city a week or two ago, to abate the miseries\n",
      "of summer housekeeping. I could make half a dozen kinds of biscuit\n",
      "sandwiches in ten minutes, and I could give them iced tea with lemon\n",
      "and sugar, and oh--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's been so much excitement to-day that I entirely forgot the\n",
      "grand surprise I'd planned for some of the farmers' wives. I declare\n",
      "'tis too bad! Our ice-cream freezer came last week, you know, and this\n",
      "morning I made the first lot, and I was going to serve saucers of it\n",
      "to some of the women who came to the store--it seems that ice-cream is\n",
      "unknown in this country. But your surprise, of putting the Grand Army\n",
      "men into uniforms, put everything else out of my mind for the day.\n",
      "Let's bring it from the ice-house, and send it over to Caleb's room to\n",
      "the veterans!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear girl, the cream will keep till to-morrow, so do try to possess\n",
      "your soul in peace, and leave those veterans to their own devices. Old\n",
      "soldiers are reputed to be willing to eat and drink anything or nothing\n",
      "if they may have a feast of war-stories.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When do you suppose they'll begin to sing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not having been a soldier, I can't say. Perhaps not at all, if Caleb's\n",
      "plan of keeping the drinking men from liquor has succeeded.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil, don't be so horrid. Oh!--what is that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the beginning of a song--not badly sung, either--\"'Tis a Way We\n",
      "Have in the Army.\" Some of the words were ridiculous, but there could\n",
      "be no criticism of the spirit of the singers. Advancing cautiously,\n",
      "under cover of semi-darkness and the brushwood arbor, Grace saw so many\n",
      "figures near the front of the house that she could not doubt that the\n",
      "Grand Army Post was tendering her or her husband the compliment of a\n",
      "serenade, so she applauded heartily. Another song, \"There's Music in\n",
      "the Air,\" followed, and yet another, both in fair time and tune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to find out whom those leading voices belong to,\" Grace\n",
      "said. \"Light the lamps, won't you?\" Then she stepped from the arbor,\n",
      "and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you very much, gentlemen, but my husband and I are real selfish\n",
      "people, so we won't be satisfied until you come into the house and sing\n",
      "us all the army songs you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two or three veterans started to run, but they were stopped by others.\n",
      "Grace heard them protesting that they were not of the singers, so she\n",
      "hurried out and declared that she would forego the anticipated pleasure\n",
      "rather than break up their own party; so within a moment or two the\n",
      "entire Post, with One-Arm Ojam, were in the parlor, where some stared\n",
      "about in amazement, while others looked as distressed as cats in a\n",
      "strange kitchen. But host and hostess pressed most of them into seats,\n",
      "and Caleb stood guard at the door, having first whispered to Grace:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The pianner'll hold 'em--but don't play 'Marchin' through Georgy,'\n",
      "please; we take pains not to worry One-Arm Ojam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace whispered to Philip, who left the room; then she seated herself\n",
      "at the piano and rattled off \"Dixie\" with fine spirit. Soon she\n",
      "stopped, looked about inquiringly, and asked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can't any of you sing it? Now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she attacked the piano. Some one started the song,\n",
      "darkey-fashion, by singing one bar, the others joining vociferously\n",
      "in the second; this was repeated, and then all gave the chorus, and\n",
      "so the song went on so long as any one could recall words. This was\n",
      "followed, at a venture, by \"Maryland, my Maryland,\" for which the Union\n",
      "veterans had one set of words, and Ojam another, although the general\n",
      "effect was good. The ice was now broken, and the men suggested one song\n",
      "after another, for most of which Grace discovered that she knew the\n",
      "airs--for while the war created many new songs, it inspired little new\n",
      "music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The singing continued until the guests became hoarse, by which time\n",
      "Philip entered with iced lemonade made with tea, and Grace followed\n",
      "with sandwiches and biscuits and cake, which prompted some of the\n",
      "men to tell what they did not have to eat in the army. From this to\n",
      "war-stories was but a short step, and as every veteran, however stupid,\n",
      "has at least one war-story that is all his own, the host and hostess\n",
      "enjoyed a long entertainment of a kind entirely new to them. Meanwhile\n",
      "Grace was pressing refreshments on the men individually, but suddenly\n",
      "she departed. When she returned, in a few moments, she bore a tray\n",
      "covered with saucers of ice-cream, and the astonishment which the\n",
      "contents produced, as it reached the palates of the guests, made Grace\n",
      "almost apoplectic in her endeavors to keep from laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" whispered a veteran who had not yet been served to one\n",
      "who was ecstatically licking his spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dog my cats if I know!\" was the reply, as the man took another\n",
      "mouthful. \"It tastes somethin' like puddin'--an' custard--an'\n",
      "cake--an' like the smell of ol' Mis' Madden's vanilla bean,--an'--\" but\n",
      "just then the questioner was given an opportunity to taste for himself,\n",
      "after which he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It beats the smell o' my darter's hair-ile--beats it all holler.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon,\" said Caleb, who had inspected the freezer on its arrival,\n",
      "and had been wildly curious as to its product, \"I reckon it's\n",
      "ice-cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? That stuff that there's jokes about in the newspapers\n",
      "sometimes,--jokes about gals that's too thin-waisted to hug, but can\n",
      "eat barl's of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; that's the stuff.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dickens! Well, ef I was a gal, I'd let out tucks all day long an'\n",
      "durn the expense, if my feller'd fill my bread-basket with stuff like\n",
      "that. Must be frightful costly, though.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not more'n plain custard, Mis' Somerton says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wh-a-a-a-a-at? Say, Caleb, I'm goin' to j'in the church, right\n",
      "straight off. No more takin' any risks o' hell for me, thank you, for\n",
      "it stands to reason that they can't make ice-cream down there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the contents of the freezer were exhausted, Philip, who never\n",
      "smoked, opened a box of fine cigars which he had ordered from the\n",
      "East, with a view to business with visiting lawyers in the approaching\n",
      "\"Court-week.\" Then the joy of the veterans was complete; the windows\n",
      "were opened, for, as Caleb said, no mosquito would venture into such a\n",
      "cloud, and it was not until midnight that any one thought to ask the\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afeared,\" said Caleb, after all the other guests had departed,\n",
      "\"that you'll have a mighty big job o' dish-washin' to-morrow, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But 'twas richly worth it,\" Grace said, and Philip assented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's very kind o' you, but 'tain't what I was goin' to say, which\n",
      "was that I'll turn in and help, if you'll let me, an' another thing is,\n",
      "you've put an end to any chance of any of the boys takin' a drink of\n",
      "anythin' stronger than water to-night, an' you've made sure of some new\n",
      "customers, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Caleb!\" Grace said, \"can't we do anything hearty for its own sake,\n",
      "without being rewarded for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nary thing!\" Caleb replied. \"That's business truth, an' Gospel truth,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"First-rate--A 1,\" Caleb replied, rubbing his hands, and then laughing\n",
      "to himself a long time, although in a manner which implied that the\n",
      "excitement to laughter was of a confidential nature. But this merely\n",
      "piqued curiosity, so Philip said:--\n",

      "gives me so much comfort that I talked it up to other men, but 'twas a\n",
      "new idee 'round here, an' ev'rybody laughed at me. The baths, though,\n",
      "scared a lot o' the boys into tryin' it. All day long they were kind o'\n",
      "wonderin', out loud, whether it was the cleanin' up or the underclothes\n",
      "that made 'em feel so much better'n usual; so I says to 'em, 'What's\n",

      "religion, an' even that loses its holt if you squat down with it an'\n",

      "\n",
      "But what rose is without its thorn? In the course of a few days the\n",
      "word went about, among the very large class to whom everything is fuel\n",
      "for the flame of gossip, that a lot of the Grand Army men had been\n",
      "taken into the Somerton house, and found it a palace, the things in\n",
      "which must have cost thousands of dollars, and that it was a shame\n",
      "and an outrage that money should have been made out of the poor,\n",
      "overworked country people to support two young stuck-ups from the city\n",
      "in more luxury than Queen Elizabeth ever dreamed of; for who ever read\n",
      "in history books of Queen Elizabeth having ice-cream? and didn't the\n",
      "history books say that she had only rushes on her floors, instead\n",
      "of even a rag carpet, to say nothing of picture carpets like the\n",
      "Somertons'?\n",
      "\n",
      "When the rumor reached the store, Philip ground his teeth, but Grace\n",

      "\"Wouldn't you, Caleb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon I would. Anyhow, it sounds a mighty sight better than the\n",

      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By refurnishing the parlor for the summer. The dust is ruining our\n",
      "nice things, so the change will be an economy. I'll do it so cheaply\n",
      "that almost any farmer in the county can afford to copy it, to the\n",
      "great delight of his wife, as well as himself. Let--me--see--\" and\n",
      "Grace dropped her head over a bit of paper and a pencil, and Caleb\n",
      "looked at her admiringly, and winked profoundly at Philip, and then\n",
      "hurried into the back room so that his impending substitute for an\n",
      "ecstatic dance should not disturb the planner of the coming parlor\n",
      "decorations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason--perhaps excitement over the bath-house, or surprise\n",
      "at the uniforming of his Grand Army command, or the heat, or the\n",
      "debilitating effect of old wounds--Philip pretended to believe it\n",
      "was the effect of Grace's ice-cream upon a system not inured to such\n",
      "compounds--Caleb suddenly became disabled by a severe malarial attack\n",
      "with several complications. He did not take to his bed, but his\n",
      "movements were mechanical, his manner apathetic, and his tongue almost\n",
      "silent. He did not complain; and when questioned, he insisted that he\n",
      "suffered no pain. Philip and Grace endeavored to tempt his appetite,\n",
      "for he ate scarcely anything, and they tried to rally him by various\n",
      "mental means, but without effect. He noted their solicitude, and its\n",
      "sincerity impressed him so deeply that he said one day:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The worst thing about this attack is that I can't get words to tell\n",
      "you how good you both are bein' to me. But I'm the same as a man that's\n",
      "been hit with a club.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Philip and Grace insisted that Doctor Taggess should do something\n",
      "for Caleb, and the Doctor said nothing would give him more pleasure;\n",
      "for anything that would restore Caleb to health would probably be\n",
      "serviceable in other cases of the same kind, of which there were\n",
      "several on his hands. After listening to much well-meant but worthless\n",
      "suggestion, the Doctor said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a new treatment of which I've heard encouraging reports, but\n",
      "it is quite costly. It is called the sea treatment. It is said, on good\n",
      "authority, that a month at sea, anywhere in the temperate zone, will\n",
      "cure any chronic case of malaria, and that the greater the attack of\n",
      "sea-sickness, the more thorough will be the cure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb shall try it, no matter what the cost,\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor smiled, shook his head doubtfully, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if he won't? He is so bound up in you and your business, and his\n",
      "own many interests and duties, that he will make excuses innumerable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite likely, but I ought to be ingenious enough to devise some way of\n",
      "making it appear a matter of duty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you can, and that you'll begin at once, if only for my sake,\n",
      "professionally, so that I may study the results.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, for a day, Philip became almost as silent as Caleb, and Grace\n",
      "assisted him. The next morning, he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb, I want to start a new enterprise that will revolutionize this\n",
      "part of the country and part of Europe, too, if it succeeds, but it\n",
      "won't work unless you join me in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know I'm yours to command,\" Caleb replied, at the same time\n",
      "forcing a tiny gleam of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's kind of you, but this project of mine is so unusual that I\n",
      "almost fear to suggest it. You know that the farmers of this section\n",
      "plant far more corn than anything else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, 'n always will, I reckon, no matter how small the price of what\n",
      "they can't put into pork. The idee o' corn-plantin' 's been with 'em\n",
      "so long that I reckon it's 'petrified in their brain structure,' as a\n",
      "scientific sharp I once read about, said about somethin' else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so, and we can't hope to change it unless labor and horses\n",
      "should suddenly become cheaper and more plentiful. Now I propose\n",
      "that we take advantage of this state of affairs by making some money\n",
      "and getting some glory, besides indirectly helping the farmers, by\n",
      "increasing the future demand for corn. You yourself once told me that\n",
      "if the people of Europe could learn to eat corn-bread, 'twould be\n",
      "money in their own pockets, relieve corn-bins here of surplus stock,\n",
      "and perhaps lessen the quantity of the corn spoiled by being made into\n",
      "whiskey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a fact,\" said Caleb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well. Corn never was cheaper here than it is now,--so I'm\n",
      "told,--nor were the mills ever so idle. I can buy the best of\n",
      "corn-meal, barrelled, and deliver it in London or Liverpool, freight\n",
      "paid, at less than two dollars per barrel, and I can buy all I want of\n",
      "it on my note at six months. If you'll go into the enterprise with me,\n",
      "every barrel shall be labelled 'Claybanks Western Corn-Flour: trademark\n",
      "registered by Philip Somerton.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hooray for Claybanks! Hooray for the West!\" shouted Caleb, becoming\n",
      "more like his old self.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you. But as I've quoted to you about your bath-house project,\n",
      "'You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.' Meal\n",
      "has often been sent to the English market, and some dealers have even\n",
      "sent careful cooking and bread-making directions. The different methods\n",
      "of making good food from corn-meal must, I am satisfied, be shown,\n",
      "practically, before the eyes of possible consumers. So my plan is this:\n",
      "to send over, say, two hundred barrels to London; hire for a month\n",
      "a small shop in a district thickly inhabited by people who know the\n",
      "value of a penny saved, cook in various forms--hasty pudding, hoe-cake,\n",
      "dodgers, muffins, corn-bread, etc., at the rate of a barrel of meal a\n",
      "day, or as much as can be sold, or even given away as an advertisement\n",
      "of the 'Claybanks Western Corn-Flour'--meanwhile persuading grocers\n",
      "in the vicinity to keep the meal for sale to persons who are sensible\n",
      "enough to appreciate it. And finally, as you know how to make all sorts\n",
      "of good things of corn-meal, I'd like you to go over to England and\n",
      "manage the entire business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wh-e-e-e-e-e-ew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's somewhat non-committal, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well!\" said Caleb, \"I reckon the malary's knocked plumb out o' me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so; but if it isn't, it will be; for Doctor Taggess says that\n",
      "a month at sea is the newest treatment prescribed for malaria, and\n",
      "that is said to be a sure cure. The trip over won't take a month, but\n",
      "a week or ten days of the ocean ought to make a beginning, and show\n",
      "you how 'twill act, and if the enterprise makes a hit, I'll show my\n",
      "appreciation by standing the expense of a trip up the Mediterranean and\n",
      "back by direct steamer to the United States. By the way, while you're\n",
      "up the Mediterranean, you might join one of Cook's tourist parties,\n",
      "and see the Holy Land. How does the entire plan strike you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How--does it--strike me?\" drawled Caleb. Then he pulled himself\n",
      "together and continued: \"Why, it's struck me all of a heap. Say,\n",
      "Philip, you've got a mighty long head--do you know it? I ain't sayin'\n",
      "that I can't do the work middlin' well, though I have heard that it\n",
      "takes a pickaxe an' a corkscrew to get any new idee into the commoner\n",
      "kinds of the English skull. An' a trip through the Holy Land! But\n",
      "say--who'd look after my Sunday-school class while I was away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I will, if you can't find a better substitute. You've been doing\n",
      "your best to get me into church work--you know you have, you sly scamp.\n",
      "Now's your chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To break you into that sort o' work,\" said Caleb, slowly, \"I'd be\n",
      "willin' to peddle ice in Greenland, an' live on the proceeds. But\n",
      "there's my other class--though I s'pose I could farm that out for a\n",
      "spell. Then there's a lot o' folks that's been lookin' to me for one\n",
      "thing an' another so long that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That perhaps 'twould do them good to be obliged to depend upon\n",
      "themselves for a few weeks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil dear, don't be heartless! Caleb, couldn't you trust those people\n",
      "to a woman for a little while?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, couldn't I! An' I thank you from the bottom of my heart besides.\n",
      "London! Then I could see Westminster Abbey, an' the Tower o' London,\n",
      "an' go to John Wesley's birthplace, an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Philip, \"and you could run over to Paris, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sir!\" exclaimed Caleb. \"When I want to see Satan an' his kingdom,\n",
      "I won't have to travel three thousan' mile to do it. But--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But me no more buts, Caleb--unless you would rather not go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rather not, indeed! If I was dyin' as hard of malary as I'm dyin' to\n",
      "see some things in England, I guess I'd turn up in kingdom-come in\n",
      "about three days, almanac-time. What I was 'buttin'' about was only\n",
      "this: are you plumb sure that I'm the right man for the job?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite sure; for you're entirely honest, industrious, and persistent;\n",
      "you're as corn-crazy as any other Western man; you've taught my wife\n",
      "and me how to work a lot of unsuspected delicacies out of corn-meal;\n",
      "and, more important than all else, for this purpose, you've the special\n",
      "Western faculty of taking a man's measure at once and treating him\n",
      "accordingly. If that won't work with the English,--and the worst of\n",
      "them can't be any stupider than certain people here,--nothing will.\n",
      "So the matter is settled, and you're to start at once--to-morrow, if\n",
      "possible; for first I want you to buy me a lot of goods in New York. My\n",
      "wife and I have determined to carry a larger stock and more variety,\n",
      "and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Start to-morrow!\" interrupted Caleb, incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; the longer you wait, the longer 'twill take you to get away.\n",
      "Besides, I want to keep the corn-meal enterprise a secret, and you're\n",
      "so honest that it'll leak from you if you don't get off at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I can't get--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you can, no matter what it is. And while you are attending to\n",
      "business in New York you must sleep down by the seaside, so that the\n",
      "sea air shall begin its fight with the malaria as soon as possible.\n",
      "I shall engage a room for you by telegraph to-day; you can reach it\n",
      "by rail within an hour from any part of the city, and return in the\n",
      "morning as early as you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, man alive, you haven't got the corn-meal yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall have a lot of it on the rail by a week from to-day; the rest\n",
      "can follow. You'll need a fortnight in New York, to do the buying\n",
      "and see the sights, for the town is somewhat larger than Claybanks.\n",
      "Besides, no self-respecting American should go abroad until he has\n",
      "seen Niagara Falls, Independence Hall, Bunker Hill Monument, and the\n",
      "National Capital. The Falls are directly on your route East, Washington\n",
      "is a short and cheap trip from New York, with Philadelphia between\n",
      "the two cities, and you can take a steamer from Boston. Now pack\n",
      "your gripsack at once--there's a good fellow, and don't say a single\n",
      "good-by. I'm told they're dreadfully unlucky. After you've started,\n",
      "I'll explain to every one that you've gone East to buy some goods\n",
      "for me. At present I'll settle down to making you a route-book, with\n",
      "information about all sorts of things that you may wish, after you're\n",
      "off, that you'd asked about.\"\n",

      "Caleb retired slowly to his room over the store; Philip and Grace\n",
      "took turns for an hour in watching the street for Doctor Taggess and\n",
      "in sending messengers in every direction for him, and when the Doctor\n",
      "arrived, they unfolded to him, under injunctions of secrecy, the entire\n",
      "plan regarding Caleb. The Doctor listened with animated face and\n",
      "twinkling eyes, until the story ended; then he relieved himself of a\n",
      "long, hearty laugh, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would your Uncle Jethro say to such an outlay of money?\"\n",

      "\"If he's where I hope he is,\" Philip replied, \"he knows that Caleb\n",

      "service. Besides, we've earned the money, in excess of any previous\n",
      "half-year of trade; so even if the commercial project fails I shall be\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ALL of Grace's spare hours for a fortnight after Caleb's departure\n",
      "were spent in recalling and applying the makeshift furniture devices\n",
      "of her native village and those described in back numbers of \"Ladies'\n",
      "Own\" papers and magazines, as well as all the upholstery and other\n",
      "decorative methods of her sister-saleswomen in the days when she\n",
      "and they had far more taste than money. Chairs and lounges were\n",
      "extemporized from old boxes and barrels, cushioned with straw or\n",
      "corn-husks, and covered with chintz. A roll of cheap matting, ordered\n",
      "from the city, drove the rugs from the sitting room and parlor, and\n",
      "the cheapest of hangings replaced the lace curtains at the windows.\n",
      "All of the framed pictures were sent upstairs, and upon the walls were\n",
      "affixed, with furniture tacks, many borderless pictures, plain and\n",
      "colored, from the collection which Philip and Grace had made, in past\n",
      "years, from weekly papers and Christmas \"Supplements.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The vases, too, disappeared, though substitutes for them were found.\n",
      "Dainty tables, brackets, etc., were replaced by some made from\n",
      "fragments of boxes, the completed structures being stained to imitate\n",
      "more costly woods, and instead of the couple's darling bric-à-brac\n",
      "appeared oddities peculiar to the country--some birds and small animals\n",
      "stuffed by Black Sam, birds'-nests, dried flowers, a mass of heads\n",
      "of wheat, oats, rye, and sorghum arranged as a great bouquet, some\n",
      "turkey-tail fans, and so many other things that had attracted Grace in\n",
      "her drives and walks that there seemed no room on mantel, tables, and\n",
      "walls for all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There!\" Grace exclaimed, as she ushered her husband into the parlor at\n",

      "\"Bless me!\" Philip exclaimed. \"Absolutely harmonious in color, besides\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I _shall_ imagine it, and I don't believe I shall be disappointed. All\n",

      "gal that was expectin' her feller, an' was boun' to make him pop the\n",
      "question right straight off.\" At the other end of the table was Mrs.\n",
      "Taggess, plainly attired, except for her habitual smile, and at either\n",
      "side sat five as differing shapes--except for sharp features and\n",
      "inquiring eyes--as could be found anywhere. One wore black silk with\n",
      "much affectation of superiority to the general herd, but the others\n",
      "seemed to have prepared for a wild competition in colors of raiment and\n",
      "ribbons, and one had succeeded in borrowing for the day the original\n",
      "and many-colored silk of Mrs. Hawk Howlaway, described in an early\n",
      "chapter of this narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests did full justice to the repast. One by one they became\n",
      "mystified by the number of courses, for they had expected pie or\n",
      "pudding to follow the first dish. Some began to be apprehensive of the\n",
      "future, but with the fine determination characteristic of \"settlers,\"\n",
      "good and bad alike, they continued to ply knife and fork and spoon.\n",
      "For some time the efforts of the hostess and Mrs. Taggess to encourage\n",
      "conversation were unrewarded, though some of the guests exchanged\n",
      "questions and comments in guarded tones. All acted with the apparent\n",
      "unconcern of the North American Indian; but curiosity, a tricky\n",
      "quality at best, suddenly compelled one gaunt woman to exclaim, as she\n",
      "contemplated the dish before her and raised it to her prominent nose:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What on airth is that stuff, I'd like to know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is lobster salad,\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I couldn't somehow make out what kind of an animile the meat come\n",
      "off of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nuther could I,\" said her vis-à-vis, with a full mouth, \"but I'm goin'\n",
      "to worry my ole man to raise some of 'em on the farm, for it's powerful\n",
      "good, an' no mistake.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A buzz of assent went round the table; the ice was broken, so another\n",
      "guest said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mis' Somerton, I've been dyin' to know what that there soup was made\n",
      "of that we begun on. I never tasted anythin' so good in all my born\n",
      "days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed? I'm very glad you liked it. 'Twas made of crawfish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A score of knives and forks clattered upon plates, and ten women\n",
      "assumed attitudes of amazement and consternation. Finally one of them\n",
      "succeeded in gasping:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Them little things that bores holes 'longside the crick? the things\n",
      "that boys makes fish-bait of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The same, though only millionnaires' sons could afford to use them\n",
      "for bait in the East. Crawfish meat in New York costs as much as--oh,\n",
      "a single pound of it costs as much as a big sugar-cured ham. I never\n",
      "dreamed of buying it--I never dared hope that I might taste it--until I\n",
      "came out here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of a new course checked conversation on the subject, but\n",
      "one of the guests eyed suspiciously a tiny French chop, the tip of its\n",
      "bone covered with paper, and said to the woman at her right:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't appear to know what we're bein' fed with here. Wonder what this\n",
      "is? It's little enough to be a side bone o' cat. Must be all right,\n",
      "though; Mis' Taggess is eatin' hern.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A form of blanc-mange was another mystery. Said one woman to another:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be the ice-cream the soldiers told about, for it's powerful\n",
      "cold, besides bein' powerful good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so,\" was the reply; \"but 'pears to me I didn't hear the men say\n",
      "nothin' about there bein' gravy poured on theirn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the guests were becoming full to their extreme capacity,--a\n",
      "condition which stimulates geniality in some natures, ugliness in\n",
      "others. They had come to criticise--to learn of their hostess's\n",
      "extravagance. They had remained in the parlor only long enough to be\n",
      "entirely overcome by its magnificence and to exchange whispered remarks\n",
      "about the shameful waste of money wrung from the hard-working farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner had been good beyond their wildest expectations; not the\n",
      "best Fourth of July picnic refreshments, or even the memorable dinner\n",
      "given by Squire Burress, the richest farmer in the county, when his\n",
      "daughter was married, compared with it. What was so good must also\n",
      "have been very expensive. Criticism must begin with something, and the\n",
      "blanc-mange seemed a proper subject to one woman, who was reputed to\n",
      "be very religious. So she groaned:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This--whatever it is--is so awful good that it must ha' been sinful\n",
      "costly--actually sinful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" sighed another. \"One might say, a wicked waste o' money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blanc-mange?--costly?\" Grace said, curbing an indignant impulse; \"why,\n",
      "'tis nothing but corn-starch, milk, sugar, and a little flavoring. I\n",
      "wonder what dessert dish could be cheaper!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't say!\" exclaimed a woman less malevolent or more practical\n",
      "than the others. \"Now, I just ain't a-goin' to give you no peace till\n",
      "you give me the receipt for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll give it, with pleasure; or better still, you shall have a package\n",
      "of the corn-starch,--'tis worth only a few cents,--with full directions\n",
      "on the label. I might possibly forget some part of them, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me too,\" said several women as one, and criticism was temporarily\n",
      "abated. Before a new excuse for reviving it could be found, the\n",
      "ice-cream--the real article, and without gravy, of course--made its\n",
      "appearance. It was consumed in silence, in as much haste as possible\n",
      "with anything so cold, and also with evident enjoyment. Then the\n",
      "opponent of sinful extravagance remarked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's awful good--too good! It 'pears wicked to enjoy any earthly thing\n",
      "so much. Besides, you needn't tell me that _it_ ain't awful costly,\n",
      "'cause I shan't believe it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If my word is of so doubtful quality,\" said Grace, with rising color,\n",
      "\"perhaps Mrs. Taggess, with whom you're better acquainted, will inform\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis nothing but milk, cream, and sugar,\" said Mrs. Taggess, who\n",
      "had borrowed Grace's freezer and experimented with it, \"and most of\n",
      "you know very well that you've so much milk that you feed some of it\n",
      "to your pigs. The cream in what all of you have eaten would make,\n",
      "perhaps, a single pound of butter, which you would be glad to sell for\n",
      "fifteen cents. The sugar cost not more than five or six cents, and the\n",
      "flavoring, to any one with raspberries in their own garden, would have\n",
      "cost nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests gasped in chorus, but the tormentor quickly said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the ice! Us poor farmin' folks can't afford ice; it's only them\n",
      "that makes their livin' out of us--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" said Mrs. Taggess, \"but many of the farmers, your husband\n",
      "among them, have been telling Doctor Taggess recently that they were\n",
      "going to put up ice-houses next winter, and that they were foolish\n",
      "or lazy for not having already done so before. I'm sure that all of\n",
      "you who have enjoyed the cream so greatly will keep your husbands in\n",
      "mind of it, especially as ice-cream, made at home, is as cheap as the\n",
      "poorest food that any farmer's family eats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The coming of the coffee caused conversation to abate once more, for in\n",
      "each cup floated a puff of whipped cream--a spectacle unfamiliar to any\n",
      "of the gossips, some of whom hastily spooned and swallowed it, in the\n",
      "supposition that it was ice-cream, put in to cool the coffee somewhat.\n",
      "Those who followed the motions of their hostess and Mrs. Taggess\n",
      "stirred the whipped cream into the coffee, and enjoyed the result, but\n",
      "again the voice of the tormentor arose:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We buy all our coffee at your store, but we don't never have none that\n",
      "tastes like this here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed?\" Grace said, with an air of solicitude. \"I wonder why, for\n",
      "there is but one kind in the store, and this was made from it. Perhaps\n",
      "we prepare it in different ways.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I bile mine a plumb half-hour,\" said the tormentor, \"so's to git ev'ry\n",
      "mite o' stren'th out o' it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! I never boil mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She never boiled coffee! Would the wonders of this house and its\n",
      "housekeeper never cease?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For pity sakes, how does any one make coffee without boilin', _I'd_\n",
      "like to know?\" said a little woman with a thin, aquiline nose and a\n",
      "piercing voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to do it,\" said Grace, \"by putting finely ground coffee in\n",
      "a strainer, and letting boiling water trickle through it, but the\n",
      "strainer melted off one day, through my carelessness, so now I put the\n",
      "coffee in a cotton bag, tie it, throw it into the pot, pour on boiling\n",
      "water, set it on the cooler part of the stove, and let it stand without\n",
      "boiling for five minutes. Then I take out the bag and its contents, to\n",
      "keep the coffee from getting a woody taste. My husband, who often makes\n",
      "the coffee in the morning, throws the ground coffee into cold water,\n",
      "lets it stand on the stove until it comes to a boil, and removes it at\n",
      "once. I'm not yet sure which way is the best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Taggess, \"although I've tasted it here made in both\n",
      "ways, and seen it made, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests were so astonished that each took a second cup--not that\n",
      "they really wanted it, as one explained to two others, but to see\n",
      "whether it really was as good as it had seemed at first. Then Grace\n",
      "arose, and led the way to the parlor. Some of the guests were loath to\n",
      "follow, among them the tormentor, who said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I s'pose if I'd talked about these crockery dishes, she'd have faced\n",
      "me down, an' tried to make me believe they didn't cost as much as\n",
      "mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, she wouldn't,\" said Mrs. Taggess, who overheard the remark;\n",
      "\"but I think 'twas very kind of her to set out her very best china,\n",
      "don't you? Most people do that only for their dearest friends--never\n",
      "for people who forget the manners due to the woman of the house,\n",
      "whoever she may be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see what you mean by that, Mis' Taggess, I'm sure. I only--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, well, try not to 'only' in the parlor, for Mrs. Somerton is trying\n",
      "very hard to make us feel entirely at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, _I_ think she's just tryin' to show off, 'cause she's come into\n",
      "old Jethro's money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Show off with what? Do tell me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, with her fine furniture an' fixin's. If that best room o' hern\n",
      "was mine, I'd be 'feared to use it, an' I'd expect the house to be\n",
      "struck by lightnin' to punish me for my wicked pride.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a-dyin' to ask her what some o' them things cost,\" said another,\n",
      "\"but I don't quite dass to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you may stop dying at once, for I'll ask her for you, although I\n",
      "already know, within a few cents, the price of everything in the room.\n",
      "Come along, now. Ahem! Mrs. Somerton, there's much curiosity among the\n",
      "ladies as to the cost of furnishing your beautiful parlor. Won't you\n",
      "tell us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very gladly,\" Grace said, \"for I'm very proud of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I tell you?\" whispered the tormentor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything in the parlor, except the piano, which is the ugliest thing\n",
      "in it,\" Grace continued, \"cost less than twenty dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sho!\" exclaimed one woman, incredulously. \"Why, that's no more money\n",
      "than Squire Burress paid for the sofy that his gals is courted on, for\n",
      "Mis' Burress told me the price o' that sofy herself, an' showed me the\n",
      "bill to prove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no bills to show,\" Grace said, with a laugh, \"for the largest\n",
      "articles are made of scraps, such as my husband gives away to any one\n",
      "who asks for them. See here--\" as she spoke she turned a chair upside\n",
      "down to show that its basis was a barrel. Then she raised the drapery\n",
      "of a divan to show the unpainted boxes beneath. \"The matting on the\n",
      "floor is three times as cheap as rag carpet. You can buy the window\n",
      "hangings in the store at fifteen cents a yard--though don't imagine I'm\n",
      "trying to advertise the goods. All the furniture covers are of cheap\n",
      "bedquilt chintzes. Examine everything, ladies; for, as I've already\n",
      "said, I'm very proud of my cheap little parlor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You didn't say nothin' about the cost of the labor,\" said the\n",
      "tormentor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" Grace admitted, \"but I can reckon it with very little trouble,\n",
      "for I did it all myself; I've no grown sons and daughters, like some of\n",
      "you, so I did it alone. Besides my time it cost me--well, to be exact,\n",
      "one thumb bruised with the hammer; one finger ditto; a bad scratch on\n",
      "one hand, caused by a saw slipping; half a day of pain in one eye, into\n",
      "which I blew some sawdust; two sore knees, got while putting down the\n",
      "matting; and one twisted ankle--I accidentally stepped from a box while\n",
      "tacking a picture to the wall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm clean beat out o' my senses!\" confessed one guest. \"I never\n",
      "heerd tell that they learned such work to women in cities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps they don't,\" Grace said, \"but I learned most of it when I was\n",
      "a country girl in western New York.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? You a country gal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I am. I can milk cows, churn butter, make garden, take care of\n",
      "chickens, saw wood and split it, wash clothes, and do any other country\n",
      "housework, besides making my own clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman who had elicited this information looked slowly from face to\n",
      "face among her acquaintances, and then said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon we're a passel o' fools.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,--excuse me; but I assure you that I meant nothing of the kind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I do, an' I mean it strong, too; yes, ma'am. We're a passel o'\n",
      "fools. I won't feel over an' above safe until I git home an' take a\n",
      "good long think, an' I reckon the sooner the rest of us go too, the\n",
      "seldomer we'll put our foot in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was general acquiescence in this suggestion; even the tormentor\n",
      "seemed suppressed, but suddenly her eyes glared, her lips hardened,\n",
      "and she said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose that scrumptious dress o' yourn was made o' scraps, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace laughed merrily, and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not far from right, for 'tis made of old Madras window curtains\n",
      "that cost eight cents a yard when new. There wasn't enough of the stuff\n",
      "to cover all my windows here, so I made it up into a dress rather than\n",
      "waste it, for I liked the pattern of it very much. Oh, yes--and there's\n",
      "sixteen cents' worth of ribbon worked into it--I'd forgotten that. But\n",
      "your dress--oh, I shouldn't dare wear one so costly as a black silk.\n",
      "Really, I should think it a sinful waste of money that might do so much\n",
      "good to the poor, or to the Missionary Society, or the Bible Society,\n",
      "or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What time's it gittin' to be?\" asked the tormentor. \"I'll bet my\n",
      "husban' is jest rarin' 'roun' like a bob-tail steer in fly-time, an'\n",
      "tellin' all the other men that women never know when it's time to go\n",
      "home, an' what a long drive he's got before him, an' all the stock to\n",
      "water when he gits thar. Good-by, Mis' Somerton. Some day I'll borrer\n",
      "that ice-cream machine o' yourn, an' a hunk o' ice, if you don't mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The other women also took their leave, and soon Grace was alone with\n",
      "Mrs. Taggess, who said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd apologize for them, my dear, if you hadn't known in advance that\n",
      "they were the most malicious lot in the county.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace laughed, and replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But weren't they lots of fun?\" Mrs. Taggess embraced her hostess, and\n",

      "CALEB'S departure was effected without publicity, no one having\n",
      "known of its probability but the Somertons and Pastor Grateway, whom\n",
      "Caleb had asked to provide a temporary substitute to lead his weekly\n",
      "\"class-meetin'.\" The substitute, however, made haste to tell of his new\n",
      "dignity, so within twenty-four hours the entire town knew that Caleb\n",
      "had gone to New York, and great was the wonder; for from the date of\n",
      "the foundation of the town no Claybanker had been known to go to New\n",
      "York intentionally, although it was reported that an occasional native\n",
      "had reached the metropolis in the course of a desultory journey to the\n",
      "bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip felt quite competent to manage the business without assistance,\n",
      "early summer being, like spring, a period of business inactivity;\n",
      "but within a week he was mystified by the appearance of many people\n",
      "who had never before entered the store, but who now evinced not only\n",
      "a willingness but a strong desire to become customers. Referring to\n",
      "a full list which Caleb had prepared months before, but which until\n",
      "now had lain unnoticed in the desk,--a list of adults throughout the\n",
      "county,--Philip found opposite the names of the visitors some comments\n",
      "not entirely uncomplimentary; among them, \"Tricky\"; \"Shaky\"; \"Never\n",
      "believe him\"; \"Don't sell to her without written order from her dad\";\n",
      "\"Thief\"; \"Require his note, with good endorsement--he can get it\"; \"Her\n",
      "husband's published notice against trusting her\"; etc. The incursion\n",
      "increased in volume as time went on, and compelled Philip to say to\n",
      "Grace, at the end of the seventh day:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't suppose there could be so many undesirable people in a single\n",
      "fairly respectable and small county. They've evidently thought me 'an\n",
      "easy mark,' as the city boys say, if I could be found away from Caleb's\n",
      "sheltering wing, but not one of them has succeeded in getting the\n",
      "better of me. Men talk of the tact needed in avoiding the plausible\n",
      "scamps who invade business circles in the city, but after this week's\n",

      "\n",
      "Within an hour or two, a native whom Philip knew by sight and name,\n",
      "although not one of his own customers, shuffled into the store, and\n",
      "asked:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't know nobody that wants to trade goods for forty acre o' black\n",

      "more'n more ev'ry year; but my folks wants an awful lot o' stuff, an'\n",
      "my boys want me to lay in a lot o' new farmin' tools, an' make an'\n",
      "addition to the barn, an' I kind o' ciphered up what ev'rythin' wanted,\n",

      "Philip was not an expert on standing timber, but it was plain to see\n",
      "that the ground over which he rode, to and fro, was well sprinkled with\n",
      "fine black walnut trees. It lay low enough to be subject to the annual\n",
      "overflow of the creek, not far away, but Philip was bargaining for\n",
      "timber--not for land. The two men continued to ride until the farmer\n",
      "said:--\n",

      "lay out, to save time; my wife can do her sheer o' the tradin' when she\n",

      "\"Apparently the title is good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; but here's something unexpected, and quite as gratifying,--a\n",

      "is the ablest business woman in the place, and besides, she's as good\n",
      "as gold; not exactly pretty, but wonderfully charming, and as merry as\n",
      "a grig. She's a perfect witch; I'd give anything to see her demure face\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps we can find out. He says: 'I don't know whether I stood up\n",

      "to do either if Miss Truett hadn't given me a powerful lot of nudges\n",
      "and coat-tail pulls, besides swapping books with me mighty lively while\n",
      "the minister was going forward and backward in them. I won't describe\n",
      "the service; for as you and your wife belong to that sect, I guess you\n",
      "know more than I can tell you, but I will say that there was enough\n",
      "\"amens\" in it to show where us Methodists got the habit of shouting\n",
      "out in meeting; and though I can't make up my mind after only one try,\n",
      "as a lot of our customers said when your Uncle Jethro put on sale the\n",
      "first box of lump sugar that ever came to Claybanks, I reckon that it\n",
      "is a first-rate manner of worship for them that are used to it, seeing\n",
      "that John Wesley was in it, and you two, and Miss Truett, for she\n",
      "looked like a picture of an angel when she was reading and singing and\n",

      "hardened sinners, and there are plenty of them here. Why, I asked a\n",
      "policeman on Broadway where was a first-class eating-house, and he\n",
      "pointed to one that he said was the best in town, and I had fried ham,\n",
      "and they charged me seventy-five cents for it, though it wouldn't have\n",
      "weighed half a pound raw. I don't harbor bad feelings, but the owner\n",
      "of that eating-house had better shy clear of me on Judgment Day. Miss\n",

      "think I do, though I never was a giant to find out for sure. I take\n",
      "a walk morning and evening, looking at the ocean, and trying to tell\n",
      "myself what I think of it, but not a word can I get hold of. Miss\n",

      "of saying kind and merry things to some girls in other parts of the\n",

      "merely because she is overflowing with energy, and has no taste for the\n",

      "\"Yes. That is, he showed me two blazed trees, which he said marked his\n",
      "line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so. Did he say which side of the line his own property was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--no--that is, he took me over a lot of ground that contained many\n",
      "fine large walnut trees. See here, Squire, have I been swindled?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That depends. Weefer is about as smart as they make 'em, so I don't\n",
      "think he'd be fool enough to swindle any one--not, at least, so that\n",
      "the law could take hold of him. Did he say the land he showed you was\n",
      "his? Tell me exactly what he said; for if he over-reached himself, my\n",
      "old law partner would like to handle the case for you. To win a case\n",
      "against Weefer would be a great feather in his cap. The fact is that\n",
      "all the walnut on Weefer's land consists of stumps, for the trees were\n",
      "cut off two or three years ago. There's a fine lot of standing walnut\n",
      "adjoining it, but it belongs to Doctor Taggess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I am swindled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so--that is, I hope, for the sake of our old firm, which I'll\n",
      "have to go back into if I'm not reëlected, that you've a good case\n",
      "against Weefer. Now tell me--carefully--exactly what he said. Did he\n",
      "say that Taggess's land was his?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--o--o,\" said Philip, after a moment of thought, \"I can't say\n",
      "that he did. We rode out there on horseback, stopped at the edge of\n",
      "some wooded ground, and he said, 'Did you ever see finer walnut land\n",
      "than that?' Those were his very words--I'll swear to them--the old\n",
      "scoundrel!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite likely, but did he say that those trees--that land--was his?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; not in so many words, but he certainly gave me that impression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With what exact words?\" Again Philip searched his memory, but was\n",
      "compelled to reply:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With no words that I can recall. He talked rapturously about the\n",
      "beauty of a lot of walnut trees, from the money point of view.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But didn't say, in any way, that they belonged to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Confound him, no! But he handed me a deed--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's no evidence, unless it was Taggess's deed he showed you, which\n",
      "evidently it wasn't. Well, Mr. Somerton, you've got no case. Morally\n",
      "'twas a swindle--not a new one, either. He wouldn't have tried it on\n",
      "you if Caleb hadn't been away; for Caleb knows the lay and condition\n",
      "of every tract of land in this county--just as you'll know when you've\n",
      "been here long enough. You've bought forty acres that won't bring\n",
      "you anything but taxes, unless you can find some use for walnut\n",
      "stumps--and they're harder to get out than any other kind but oak,\n",
      "unless some day the land-owners along the creek combine to put up a\n",
      "levee that'll prevent overflow, so that the land can be farmed, but\n",
      "even then the stumps will be a nuisance. Hope you got it cheap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five dollars an acre,\" Philip growled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cash?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; trade.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trade, eh? Well, that's not so bad, though it's bad enough.\" The old\n",
      "man's eyes twinkled, for what man of affairs is there who does not\n",
      "enjoy the details of a smart trade--at some other man's expense? Philip\n",
      "noticed the clerk's amused expression and frowned; the clerk quickly\n",
      "continued, \"Let me give you some professional advice--no charge for\n",
      "it. Keep entirely quiet about this affair; you may be sure that Weefer\n",
      "won't talk until you do. If the story gets out, you'll never hear the\n",
      "end of it, and 'twon't do your reputation as a business man any good.\n",
      "We don't publish records of transfers in this county, and of course I\n",
      "won't mention it, and I'll see that my son doesn't either; he's the\n",
      "only other man who has access to the books.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you very much, Squire. You may count on my vote and influence if\n",
      "you're renominated.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much obliged. Whew! Five dollars an acre for a lot of walnut stumps!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Five dollars an acre, and a silk dress for Mrs. Weefer's waiver of\n",
      "dower-right,\" said Philip, so humiliated that he wished to make his\n",
      "confession complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? Well, Weefer won't talk, but whether he can harness his wife's\n",
      "tongue when she's ready to show off that silk dress is another matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip started to go, and the clerk made haste to hide his face behind\n",
      "the deed, and silently chuckle himself towards a fit of apoplexy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're absolutely sure that I've no way out of it?\" Philip said,\n",
      "pausing for an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Absolutely,\" the clerk replied, with some difficulty, his face still\n",
      "behind the deed, \"unless--you can find--a market--for--walnut stumps.\"\n",
      "Then the clerk coughed alarmingly, and Philip pulled his hat over his\n",
      "eyes and hurried away, with a consuming desire to mount his horse,\n",
      "overtake Weefer, shoot him to death, recover the wagon-load of goods,\n",
      "and particularly the silk dress given to Mrs. Weefer. When he reached\n",
      "the store, he found his wife looking pale and troubled; there were\n",
      "present also three men with very serious countenances, and one of them\n",
      "said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Somerton, I s'pose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. What can I do for you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can shell out my colt that's in your barn. I was goin' to take him\n",
      "whether or no, but your wife said you was a square man, an' would do\n",
      "what was right. Well, there's only one right thing in this case, an'\n",
      "that's to gimme back my colt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are but two horses in my stable,\" said Philip. \"One of them I've\n",
      "owned several months, and the other I bought yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who from?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From--\" Philip took from his pocket the bill of sale and read from it\n",
      "the signature:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"James Marney.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The three men exchanged grim grins, and the complainant said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His name ain't Marney, an' 'tain't James, neither. He's a no 'count\n",
      "cousin o' mine, an' his name's Bill Tewks. An' he never had no right\n",
      "of any sort or kind to the colt. The colt's mine, an' never was any\n",
      "one else's, an' I can prove it by these two men, an' one of 'em's\n",
      "depitty sheriff of our county, an' he's got a warrant for Bill's arrest\n",
      "for stealin' the hoss. My name's James Marney; I can prove it by any\n",
      "storekeeper in this town, or by Doc Taggess, or your county clerk, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take your word for it,\" Philip said hastily, for the thought of\n",
      "exposing a second business blunder to the county clerk in a single\n",
      "day--a single hour, indeed--was unendurable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see,\" continued the claimant of the horse, looking greatly\n",
      "aggrieved, \"how a man buys one man's hoss off of another man anyway,\n",
      "leastways of a no 'count shack like Bill Tewks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not,\" said Philip, \"but I may be able to enlighten you. Do you\n",
      "know a man named Caleb Wright?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Know Caleb? Who don't? That ain't all; he's the honestest man I ever\n",
      "_did_ know. I wish he was here right now, instead of off to York, as\n",
      "your wife says, for he knows me an' he knows the hoss. Why, a spell\n",
      "ago, not long after old Jethro died, an' I needed some money pooty bad,\n",
      "I writ to Caleb an' ast him what he could git me in cash for the colt,\n",
      "here in town, prices of hosses here bein' some better'n what they be\n",
      "in our county, where there ain't never city buyers lookin' aroun', and\n",
      "Caleb writ back that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One moment, please,\" said Philip. \"He wrote that any one ought to be\n",
      "glad to give you seventy-five dollars, but that you would be foolish\n",
      "to sell, because you could get far more a year later, but that if you\n",
      "really must sell, he wished you would give me the first chance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The claimant, whose eyes by this time were bulging, exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've got a pooty long mem'ry, an' it's as good as it is long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As to that, I never saw the letter until yesterday. The man who\n",
      "brought the horse showed me the letter; otherwise I shouldn't have\n",
      "purchased.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The claimant and his companions exchanged looks of astonishment, and\n",
      "the deputy drawled:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How'd he git it, Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It beats me,\" was the reply. \"Onless he went through the house like he\n",
      "did the barn. That letter was in the Bible, where I keep some papers\n",
      "o' one kind an' another, cal'latin' that's as safe a place as any, not\n",
      "gettin' much rummagin'. He must 'a' knowed I had it. Oh, he's a slick\n",
      "un, Bill is, when he gits dead broke an' wants to go on a spree. You\n",
      "see, Mr. Somerton, the way of it was this: the wife was off visitin',\n",
      "an' I was ploughin' corn, an' took some snack with me, an' some stuff\n",
      "for the hosses, so's to have a longer rest at noon-time, not havin' to\n",
      "go back all the way to the house. The colt was in the barn, so I didn't\n",
      "miss him till I got home, long about dusk. Bill must 'a' knowed, some\n",
      "way, my wife wa'n't home, an' I could see by the lot o' hay in the\n",
      "colt's rack that he'd been took out 'fore the middle o' the day. I was\n",
      "so knocked by missin' him that I've been on the track ever sence, an'\n",
      "didn't think to look to see ef anythin' was gone from the house, but\n",
      "the cuss must 'a' prowled 'roun' consid'able ef he got that letter.\n",
      "Didn't bring in my rifle an' shotgun to sell, did he, nor flat-irons,\n",
      "nor cook-stove?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, although he did sell me a saddle and bridle. I hope you'll succeed\n",
      "in catching the scamp.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I ain't got no use for him. The furder away he gits, the better\n",
      "satisfied I'll be. We ain't never had no other thief 'mong our\n",
      "relations. I reckon it's you that ought to want him. What I want is my\n",
      "colt, an' I'm goin' to have him--peaceful, ef I kin, or by law, ef I\n",
      "must. He's thar--in your barn; I seen him through the door; so did my\n",
      "frien's here, so there's no good beatin' about the bush an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop!\" said Philip. \"There's no sense in insinuating that I would\n",
      "knowingly retain stolen property--unless you wish to have your tongue\n",
      "knocked down your throat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's fair talk, Jim, an' I don't blame him for givin' it to you,\"\n",
      "suggested the deputy. \"Now you chaw yerself for a while, an' let me\n",
      "say somethin'. It don't stan' to reason that any business man is goin'\n",
      "to try to keep a stolen hoss. On 'tother han', he'd be a fool to give\n",
      "up on the word o' three men he never seen till just now. You, Jim,\n",
      "ain't such a fool as to want to air the family skunk so fur from home,\n",
      "an' Mr. Somerton here ain't likely to be over'n above anxious to have\n",
      "a fuss that'll let ev'rybody in town know that he was took in by an\n",
      "amatoor hoss-thief. Now, Jim, jest sa'nter out an' get some square man,\n",
      "an' not a storekeeper that knows ye, to come in an' speak for ye, as\n",
      "if ye wanted to buy some goods on credit. Thet'll prove who ye be, an'\n",
      "like enough he'll know me, too, 'specially if it's--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not Doctor Taggess?\" Philip suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good idee,\" the officer replied, \"for he knows both of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An' he knows the colt, too,\" said the claimant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Better and better,\" Philip declared, for anything would have been\n",
      "preferable, at Claybanks or any other Western town, to being known as\n",
      "a merchant to whom a thief could sell anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately the Doctor was at home; he came to the store, identified\n",
      "the claimant, vouched for his honesty and truthfulness, and then\n",
      "identified the colt as the claimant's property. Philip told the entire\n",
      "story to the Doctor, who said there was nothing to do but surrender the\n",
      "horse--or repurchase him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How much do you want for him, Mr. Marney?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye ain't said what ye give a'ready.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; that's a different matter. What is your price?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cash, note, or trade?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whichever you like, if the figures are right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, seein' you've been put to expense a'ready, an' I don't need\n",
      "money for a couple o' months yet, an' you'll most likely give more on\n",
      "time than in cash, I'd rather take your sixty-day note for a hundred\n",
      "back home with me than take the colt back. No other man could have him\n",
      "so cheap.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall have it--on condition, written and signed, that neither of\n",
      "you three shall tell the story of the thief's sale. No one else can\n",
      "tell it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll stand by me, boys?\" said the claimant, appealingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll take the note, Mr. Somerton, an' you've done the square\n",
      "thing. But say, I'll throw off five dollar ef ye'll tell me what ye\n",
      "paid fer him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Philip, beginning to draw a bill of sale to include the\n",
      "condition already specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll make it ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, say! I cayn't sleep peaceful without knowin', but this is rubbin'\n",
      "it in. Fifteen!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sign this, please,\" said Philip, showing the bill of sale. Then he\n",
      "passed over his own note for eighty-five dollars, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I paid seventy-five dollars, cash.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" sighed Marney, \"that's a comfort--for besides knowin' how much\n",
      "'twas, it shows what I wanted to b'lieve, that Bill was as much fool as\n",
      "scoundrel, else he'd 'a' ast more. Good-by, Mr. Somerton an' Doc.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio departed. The Doctor remained to condole with the victim,\n",
      "who could not help telling of his real-estate trade. The Doctor\n",
      "laughed,--but not too long,--then he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There ought to be finer grainings and markings, and, therefore,\n",
      "more money, in walnut roots than in the average of trees. I've been\n",
      "intending to experiment in that direction. As to that colt, let me\n",
      "drive him for you a few days; he may have the making of both prices in\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Doctor departed, Philip got out his own horse and buggy, and\n",
      "insisted that his wife should drive, but Grace was reluctant to go.\n",
      "Something seemed to be troubling her. Philip asked what it was. \"I wish\n",

      "\n",
      "\"_Et tu, Brute?_ Now is my humiliation complete; but as Caleb is where\n",
      "he is, let us make the best of it.\" So saying, he indited the following\n",
      "telegram to Caleb, for Grace to send from the railway station, three\n",
      "miles distant:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Look up a buyer for big walnut stumps.\n",

      "\"Do wait a moment, Phil! You're as curious as women are said to\n",

      "afraid the persuading, or a hint to that effect, must have been on her\n",

      "\"Should what? Fall in love with your paragon of women? Well, I suppose\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wish there were, I'm sure, for I don't know of a place more in need\n",

      "Claybanks would be far less malarious if the swamp lands could be\n",
      "drained. He says the malarious exhalation, whatever it is, seems to\n",
      "be heavier than the air, and is therefore comparatively local in its\n",
      "effects, for he has known certain towns and other small localities\n",
      "to be entirely free from it, though the surrounding country was\n",
      "full of it. Now, if some surveyor and engineer--say Mary Truett's\n",
      "brother--could find out how to drain our Claybanks swamps, it might\n",
      "make this a healthy town. Is that a very silly notion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silly? Not a bit of it! But, my dear girl, do you know what such an\n",
      "enterprise would cost?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but I do know what I suffered on the day of my awful malarial\n",
      "attack and that I shall never forget the spectacle of a poor, dear,\n",
      "little, helpless, innocent baby shaking with a chill!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor girl! Poor baby! But don't you suppose that our swamp lands have\n",
      "been studied for years by the men most interested in them--the farmers\n",
      "and other owners?--studied and worked at?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps they have, but Doctor Taggess says farmers always do things in\n",
      "the hardest way; they've not time and money to try any other. Besides,\n",
      "since I began to think of it I've often recalled a case somewhat\n",
      "similar. In our town in western New York the railway station was very\n",
      "inconvenient; it was on a bridge crossing the track, and everything and\n",
      "everybody had to go up and down stairs or up and down hill to get to\n",
      "or from it. It was talked of at town meetings and the post-office and\n",
      "other places, and public-spirited citizens roamed the line from one end\n",
      "of town to the other, looking for a spot where the station could be\n",
      "placed near the level of the track.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At last they subscribed money to pay for a new site, if the company\n",
      "would move its station to the level, and one day a surveyor and his\n",
      "men came up, and he looked about with an instrument, and a few days\n",
      "afterward a little cutting at one place and a little filling just back\n",
      "of it did the business, and all the village wiseacres called themselves\n",
      "names for not thinking of the same thing, but Grandpa said, 'It takes\n",
      "a shoemaker to make shoes.' You know the swamps are almost dry now,\n",
      "because of the hot weather; don't you suppose a surveyor and engineer,\n",
      "or even a sensible man who's studied physical geography in school,\n",
      "might be able to go over the ground and learn where and what retains\n",
      "the water? Now laugh, if you like.\"\n",

      "in favor of any improvements that are possible. They do their full\n",

      "of suffering, but there's scarcely one of them who doesn't secretly\n",
      "hope and expect to become rich some day, or at least to be part of a\n",
      "rich community; and they're not more than half wrong, for railways and\n",

      "our people expect to see them. Let me give you an illustration. A year\n",
      "or two ago I drove out one Sunday to see a family of my acquaintance,\n",

      "quinine--a common matter of forgetfulness, strange though it may seem.\n",
      "As I neared the house, I heard singing, of a peculiar, irregular kind.\n",
      "As 'twas Sunday, I supposed a neighborhood meeting was in progress.\n",
      "But there wasn't. One of the hundreds of projected Pacific railways\n",
      "had been surveyed through the farm a few months before. On the day of\n",
      "my call three of the seven members of the family were shaking with\n",
      "chills; so to keep up their spirits they were singing, to the music of\n",

      "the swamps themselves were opened, one by one, and the swamps became\n",
      "dry for the first time in their history, though small laterals, some\n",
      "to drain springs, others to guard against the accidents of a rainy\n",

      "\n",
      "The happiest man in all the town--happiest in his own estimation,\n",
      "at least--was Philip; for within a few days he had learned that the\n",

      "his father had suddenly become of great value. He had sent it to New\n",
      "York to be sold, and learned that the result was almost ten thousand\n",

      "had designated. At last he had something wholly his own, should\n",
      "sickness or possible business reverses ever make him wish to abandon\n",
      "his inheritance from his uncle. Grace shared his feeling, and was\n",

      "made Philip a greater capitalist than any other man within fifty miles.\n",
      "He could buy real estate in his own right, to be in readiness for the\n",
      "coming \"boom\" of Claybanks; he could become a banker, manufacturer,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nothing, I hope. It may go clear of us. Listen--carefully. Come apart\n",
      "from the crowd; my ears are not as keen as they used to be. Do you hear\n",
      "any sound in that direction?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing--except buzz-buzz, as if a hive of bees were swarming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad of it; it mayn't be so bad as I feared. I'm not acquainted\n",
      "with the things, except through common report. Where's Mr. Truett?\n",
      "He had field-glasses slung from his shoulder this morning. Here, you\n",
      "boys!\" the Doctor shouted to several youngsters who were playing\n",
      "leap-frog near by, \"scatter--find Mr. Truett--the man who bossed the\n",
      "big ditch, and ask him to come here--right away!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doctor!\" exclaimed Grace. \"Do tell me what you fear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell me first about that noise. Is it any louder?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. It sounds now like a distant railway train. What does it mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It means a cyclone. How bad a one, we can't tell until it has passed.\n",
      "If it keeps its present course, it will pass north of the crowd, but I\n",
      "am afraid it will strike the town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time many of the people had noticed the great cloud in the\n",
      "west, and soon the entire assemblage heard a deep, continuous roar.\n",
      "Then men, women, and children began to run, for the cloud increased in\n",
      "blackness and noise at a terrifying rate, but the Doctor shouted:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stay where you are! Get to the windward of the platform, and wagons\n",
      "and horses! Pass the word around--quick! Ah, Mr. Truett! What do you\n",
      "see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All sorts of things,\" said Truett, from behind his field-glasses.\n",
      "\"Lightning--and tree boughs--and corn-stalks--and boards--and something\n",
      "that looks like a roof. Also, oceans of rain. We're in for a soaking\n",
      "unless we hurry back to town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The soaking's the safer,\" said the Doctor, adjusting the proffered\n",
      "glasses to his own eyes. \"Ah, 'tis as I feared: it is tearing its way\n",
      "through the town. There goes the court-house roof--and the church\n",
      "steeple.\" Abruptly returning the glasses, the Doctor shouted as the\n",
      "great cloud passed rapidly to the northward and rain fell suddenly in\n",
      "torrents:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Men--only men--hurry to town, and keep close to me when you get\n",
      "there.\" Then he found his horse and buggy and led a wild throng of\n",
      "wagons, horsemen, and footmen, behind whom, despite the Doctor's\n",
      "warning, came the remaining components of the procession, and up to\n",
      "heaven went an appalling chorus of screams, prayers, and curses, for\n",
      "the word \"cyclone\"--the word most dreaded in the West since the Indian\n",
      "outbreaks ended--had passed through the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outskirts of the town were more than a mile distant, and before\n",
      "they were reached, the throng saw that several buildings were burning,\n",
      "though the rainfall seemed sufficient to extinguish any ordinary\n",
      "conflagration. Philip, who was riding with several other men in a farm\n",
      "wagon, saw, when the wagon turned into the main street, that one of\n",
      "the burning buildings was his own store. Apparently it had been first\n",
      "unroofed and crushed by the storm, for all that remained of it and its\n",
      "contents seemed to be in a pit that once was the cellar, and from which\n",
      "rose a little flame and a great column of smoke and steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's save people first; property afterward!\" he replied to the men\n",
      "in the wagon when they offered to remain with him and fight the fire.\n",
      "Afterward he received for his speech great credit which was utterly\n",
      "undeserved, for after an instant of angry surprise at his loss he was\n",
      "conscious of a strange, wild elation. A week earlier, such a blow\n",
      "would have been a serious reverse--perhaps ruin; now, thanks to his\n",
      "long-forgotten mining stock, he was fairly well off and could start\n",
      "anew elsewhere, entirely by himself and unhampered by conditions.\n",
      "He had tried hard to accept Claybanks as his home for life, and\n",
      "thought he had succeeded; but now, through the gloom of the storm,\n",
      "the outer world, especially all parts out of the cyclone belt, seemed\n",
      "delightfully inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where'll we find the people to save?\" This question, from a man in the\n",
      "wagon, recalled Philip's better self, and he replied quickly:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the path of the storm, and wherever Doctor Taggess is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It soon became evident that the cyclone path had been quite\n",
      "narrow,--not much wider, indeed, than the business street,--but the\n",
      "whirling funnel had gone diagonally over the town and thus destroyed or\n",
      "injured more than forty houses, the débris of which did much additional\n",
      "injury. Philip and the men passed rapidly from house to house along\n",
      "the new, rude clearing, and searched the ruins for dead and wounded.\n",
      "Fortunately almost all of the inhabitants of the town had taken part\n",
      "in the celebration. Those who remained were numerous enough to provide\n",
      "many fractures and bruises to be treated by Doctor Taggess and his\n",
      "corps of volunteer nurses, but apparently not one in the town had been\n",
      "killed outright. To obtain this gratifying assurance required long\n",
      "hours of searching far into the night, for some missing persons were\n",
      "found far from their homes, and with extraordinary opinions as to how\n",
      "their change of location had been effected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip worked as faithfully as any one until all the missing were\n",
      "accounted for and all the houseless ones fed and sheltered. Grace had\n",
      "given all possible help to many women and children by taking them into\n",
      "her own home. At midnight, when husband and wife met for the first time\n",
      "since the storm, they reminded each other of what might have happened\n",
      "had there been no celebration and they had been in the store and\n",
      "unconscious of the impending disaster. Together they looked at their\n",
      "own ruins, for which Philip had hired a watchman, so that he might be\n",
      "roused if the smouldering fire should gain headway and threaten the\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It might have been worse,\" Grace said. \"We have a roof to shelter us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and we may select a new roof elsewhere in the world, if we like.\n",
      "Perhaps the cyclone was, for us, a blessing in disguise--eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace did not answer at once, though her husband longed for a reply in\n",
      "keeping with his own feelings. He placed his arm around his wife, drew\n",
      "her slowly toward the house, and said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You deserve a better sphere of life than this, dear girl. You know\n",
      "well that you would never have accepted this if we had not foolishly\n",
      "committed ourselves to it without forethought or knowledge. Your energy\n",
      "and sympathy will keep you fairly contented almost anywhere, but you\n",
      "shouldn't let them make you unjust to yourself. For my own part, I've\n",
      "done no complaining, but my life here has been full of drudgery and\n",
      "anxiety. Now it seems as though deliverance had been doubly provided\n",
      "for both of us--first by the sale of our mining stock, and to-day\n",
      "through the destruction of our principal business interest. We can\n",
      "injure no one by going away; if the property reverts to the charities\n",
      "which were to be the legatees in case I declined, Caleb will be\n",
      "provided for, even if he, too, chooses to leave Claybanks. What shall\n",
      "it be--stay, or go? Dear girl, there are tears in your eyes--they are\n",
      "saying 'Go!' Let me kiss them away, in token of thanks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tears sometimes tell shocking fibs,\" said Grace, trying to appear\n",
      "cheerful. \"I wouldn't trust my eyes, or my tongue, or even my heart\n",
      "to decide anything to-night, after such a day. There's but one place\n",
      "in the whole world I shall ever care to be, after this, and that is in\n",
      "your arms--close to your heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that is so far away, and so hard to reach!\" said Philip,\n",
      "forgetting in an instant the day and all pertaining to it.\n",

      "to fill with horror-seekers and rumor-mongers from the outer world;\n",
      "but most of the natives were invisible, for they had worked and talked\n",
      "far into the night. It seemed to the Somertons that they had not slept\n",
      "an hour when they were roused by heavy knocking at the door; then\n",
      "they were amazed to find the sun quite high. The man who had done the\n",
      "knocking handed Philip a telegram, brought from the railway station, an\n",
      "hour distant. It was from New York, and read as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"Back yesterday. Good as new. English business well\n",

      "very like him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not quite sure of that,\" Philip replied, shaking his head\n",
      "doubtingly, yet smiling under his mustache. \"To be entirely like Caleb,\n",
      "it should have said that the cyclone was a means of grace.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Grace's eyes became by turns melting, luminous, dancing,--exactly as\n",
      "they had been of old, at the rare times when Philip would come home\n",
      "from the office with a pleasing surprise,--opera-tickets, perhaps, or\n",
      "the promise of an afternoon and night at the seashore, or a moonlight\n",
      "trip on the river. They reminded him of the delightful old times of\n",
      "which they seemed to promise a renewal, and his heart leaped with joy\n",
      "at the hope and belief that the answer Grace would write would break\n",
      "the chains that bound her and him to Claybanks. While Grace wrote,\n",
      "Philip closed his eyes and imagined himself and his wife spending\n",
      "a restful, delightful summer together, far from the heat, dust,\n",
      "shabbiness, and dilapidation of their part of the West. Certainly they\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because--because I fear that I am trying to sacrifice you--dooming you\n",
      "for life. The despatch shan't go, for you don't like it. Yet I wrote\n",
      "only what I thought was right. All that you inherited from your uncle\n",
      "was earned here, from the people who have suffered by the cyclone,\n",
      "or must suffer from the troubles that will follow it. 'Twould be\n",
      "heartless--really dishonest--to leave them, wouldn't it? Besides, many\n",
      "of them like us very much, and have learned to look up to us, after a\n",
      "fashion. Perhaps I wrote too hastily; it may not be practicable, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trying, at least, will be practicable,\" said Philip, after a mighty\n",
      "effort against himself. \"'When in Rome, do as the Romans do;' when with\n",
      "an angel, follow the angel's lead. I'll hire some one at once to take\n",

      "into the buggy and drive over the course of the storm in our county,\n",
      "and see if any one specially needs help.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And leave the remains of our store smouldering?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We can get Mr. Truett to attend to it. Engineers ought to know\n",
      "something about keeping fires down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder where he is. I thoughtlessly asked him to breakfast with us\n",
      "this morning. I hope he's not starving somewhere, in anticipation. I\n",
      "hope, also, that we've enough food material in the house to last a\n",
      "day or two; we've the ice-house and warehouse to fall back upon for\n",
      "meats. By the way, isn't it fortunate that I adopted Uncle Jethro's\n",
      "habit of keeping most of the store cash on my person? Otherwise we'd be\n",
      "penniless until the safe could be got from the ruins, and cooled and\n",
      "opened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While Grace was preparing breakfast Philip hurried about to learn\n",
      "whether any additional casualties of the storm had been reported, and\n",
      "he soon encountered the young engineer, who looked as cheerful as if\n",
      "cyclones were to be reckoned among blessings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been out on horseback since daylight,\" said he, \"and everything\n",
      "is lovely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's some ground for difference of opinion,\" replied Philip,\n",
      "looking at the damaged court-house and church.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I meant at the ditch and the swamps,\" the young man explained hastily.\n",
      "\"In spite of the great rainfall yesterday, the ditch did not overflow,\n",
      "nor is there any standing water in the swamps. That isn't all; enough\n",
      "trees have been knocked down, within three or four miles of town, to\n",
      "make a block pavement for the main street--perhaps enough to pave\n",
      "the road from here to the railway, so that full wagon-loads could be\n",
      "hauled all winter long. But there's still more: the creek has been\n",
      "accidentally dammed, a mile or two from town, by a bridge that the\n",
      "cyclone took from its place and set up on edge in the stream. A little\n",
      "work there, at once, would prepare a head for the water-power which I'm\n",
      "told the town has been palavering about for years, and if you don't\n",
      "want water-power, 'twould supply plenty of good water to be piped to\n",
      "town, to replace the foul stuff from wells that have been polluted by\n",
      "drainage. Doctor Taggess says some of the wells are to blame for many\n",
      "of the troubles charged to malaria.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Harold Truett,\" said Philip, \"do have mercy upon us! We'll yet\n",
      "hear of you engineers trying to get the inhabitants of a cemetery\n",
      "interested in some of your enterprises. Block pavements, indeed!--and\n",
      "water-power!--and a reservoir!--and pipe-service!--all this to a man\n",
      "whose principal lot of worldly goods is still burning, and in a town\n",
      "not yet a full day past a cyclone!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the town's all right,\" said Truett, confidently. \"At least, the\n",
      "people are. Already they're making the best of it and trying to make\n",
      "repairs, and wondering to one another, in true Western fashion, if the\n",
      "disaster won't make the town widely talked of, and give it a boom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They are, eh? Well, I shan't allow the procession to get ahead of\n",
      "me. Do you wish to superintend the transforming of my warehouse into\n",
      "a temporary store, while I hurry away to buy goods? Mrs. Somerton\n",
      "can tell you what we need. You may also see that the fire which is\n",
      "consuming the remains of the old store is kept down or put out. I think\n",
      "the two jobs will keep you very busy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite likely, but I wish you'd keep that block pavement and\n",
      "water-power and reservoir in mind, and speak to people about them. A\n",
      "town is like a man: if it must make a new start, it might as well start\n",
      "right, and for all it is worth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless me! You've been here less than two months, yet you talk like a\n",
      "rabid Westerner! Do you chance to know just when and where you caught\n",
      "the fever?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" replied the young man, with a laugh. \"I got it in New York,\n",
      "while listening to your man, Caleb Wright. I couldn't help it. I forgot\n",
      "to say that now ought to be the time to coax a practical brick-maker\n",
      "to town, and show what the banks of clay are really good for. Do it\n",
      "before the state newspapers stop sending men down here to write about\n",
      "the cyclone, and you'll get a lot of free advertising. And a railway\n",
      "company ought to be persuaded to push a spur down here; they would do\n",
      "it if you had water-power and any mills to use it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anything else? Are all engineers like you?--contriving to turn nothing\n",
      "into something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They ought to be. That's what they were made for. So were other\n",
      "people, though some of them seem slow to understand it. I wish\n",
      "you'd appoint me a reception committee to talk to all newspaper\n",
      "correspondents that come down to write up the horrors. If you'll tell\n",
      "your fellow-citizens to refer all such chaps to me, I'll engage to\n",
      "have the town's natural resources exploited in fine style.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip promised, and an hour later when he and Grace were driving\n",
      "rapidly over one of the county roads, Philip said that if Miss Truett\n",
      "were of like temperament to her brother, it was not strange that she\n",
      "was head of a large department. Still, Philip thought it strange that\n",
      "a young man of so much energy and perceptive power should see anything\n",
      "promising in Claybanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis all because of Caleb,\" Grace replied confidently. \"Mr. Truett\n",
      "says that Caleb was quite voluble about the defects of the country, but\n",
      "his truthfulness was fascinating through its uniqueness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! 'Tis evident that Caleb was the cause of Truett coming here, so\n",
      "the town is still more deeply in debt to Caleb, who, poor chap, will\n",
      "return to miss everything that he left behind him in his room, and even\n",
      "the roof that sheltered him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he was so attached to his belongings, too!\" Grace said. \"Do invite\n",
      "him, by wire, to regard our home as his own; he is not the kind of man\n",
      "to abuse the invitation, and I'm sure he will appreciate it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Within six hours Philip had seen all of his own customers who had\n",
      "been in the track of the storm, he had asked if there was anything in\n",
      "particular he could bring them from the city, and assured them that if\n",
      "they did not make free use of him, they would have only themselves to\n",
      "blame. Naturally, he did not neglect to say that within a week he would\n",
      "have on sale as large an assortment of goods as usual, and one with no\n",
      "\"dead stock\" in it. Before nightfall, he was in the nearest small city,\n",
      "and purchasing at a rate that made the dealers glad, and he was also\n",
      "ordering freely by wire from Chicago houses that had sold to Jethro\n",
      "Somerton for years, and who felt assured that no mere cyclone and fire\n",
      "could lessen the Somerton power to pay. Twenty-four hours later he\n",
      "was at home, congratulating his wife and Truett on the transformation\n",
      "of the dingy warehouse into a light, clean-appearing room, thanks to\n",
      "hundreds of yards of sheeting that had been tacked overhead in lieu of\n",
      "ceiling, and also to the walls. Counters had been extemporized, and\n",
      "shelving was going up. Some of the contents of the old store had been\n",
      "saved, and the remainder was being drenched by a bucket brigade, under\n",
      "the direction of Truett, who reported that he had had no trouble in\n",
      "securing workmen, for Mrs. Somerton had asked them as a special favor\n",
      "to her, and they had tumbled over one another in their eagerness to\n",
      "respond. As to himself, he had found time to draw exterior and interior\n",
      "plans for a new store to be erected on the old foundations, and he\n",
      "begged permission to begin work as soon as the ruins were cool; for,\n",
      "said he, \"Lumber and labor will never be cheaper here than they are\n",
      "now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I remarked before I left, you're a rabid Westerner,\" Philip said,\n",
      "in admiration of the young man's enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give it any name you like,\" was the reply, \"though I'm suggesting only\n",
      "what any Eastern man would do. Besides, I'd like to see everything well\n",
      "started or arranged before Caleb can reach here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to have become remarkably fond of Caleb on very short\n",
      "acquaintance,\" said Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have,\" was the reply, \"and since I've learned that he was sent East\n",
      "principally to regain his health, I'd like, in justice to both you and\n",
      "him, that he should find nothing to give him a setback. That's only\n",
      "fair, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis more than fair. 'Tis very hearty, and greatly to your credit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well; put it that way, if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip's goods began to arrive a day later, in farm wagons, moving\n",
      "almost in procession to and from Claybanks and the railway town, and\n",
      "several men worked at unpacking them, while Philip and Grace arranged\n",
      "them on the shelves and under the counters. When Saturday night ended\n",
      "the fourth day, the merchant and his wife were fit to enjoy a day of\n",
      "rest on Sunday. Sunday morning came, and while Philip and Grace were\n",
      "leisurely preparing their breakfast, there was a knock at the door.\n",
      "Philip opened it, and shouted:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grace!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Grace hurried from the kitchen, embraced a lady whom she saw, and\n",
      "exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary Truett!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Wright, if you please,\" replied the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg a thousand pardons!\" Grace gasped. She soon recovered herself\n",
      "and looked very roguish as she continued, \"Won't you kindly introduce\n",
      "me to the distinguished-looking stranger beside you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Caleb pushed his hat to the back of his head, slapped his leg\n",
      "noisily, and exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Distinguished--looking--stranger! Hooray!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "XXIV--HOW IT CAME ABOUT\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"NOW, Caleb,\" said Philip, after the four had been seated at the\n",
      "breakfast table so long that most of the food had disappeared, \"tell us\n",
      "all about it. Don't leave out anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" said Caleb, after emptying his coffee-cup. \"I'll begin at\n",
      "the beginning. I don't s'pose 'tis necessary to tell any of you that\n",
      "New York is a mighty big city, an' London is another, so--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"New York savors of business, and so does London,\" said Philip, \"and as\n",
      "this is Sunday, I must decline to hear a word about worldly things. I'm\n",
      "amazed that so orthodox a man as you should think of such matters on\n",
      "Sunday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell him, Caleb,\" Grace added, \"and tell me also, about something\n",
      "heavenly--something angelic, at least--something resembling a special\n",
      "mercy, or a means of grace.\" As she spoke, she looked so significantly\n",
      "at Mary, that Caleb could no longer pretend to misunderstand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said he, \"as I came back double when you expected only to see\n",
      "me single, I s'pose a word or two of explanation would only be fair to\n",
      "all concerned. You see, before I started for London I felt pretty well\n",
      "acquainted with Mary, for I'd been in New York two or three weeks. That\n",
      "mightn't seem a long time, to some, in which to form an acquaintance\n",
      "that will last through life an' eternity, but such things depend a lot\n",
      "on the person who's doin' 'em, an', as you know, my principal business\n",
      "for years has been to study human nature in general, an' particularly\n",
      "whatever specimen of it is nearest at hand. In New York it had come to\n",
      "be as natural as breathin', an' mighty interestin' too, especially when\n",
      "the person's p'ints were first-rate, an' I had reason to believe that I\n",
      "was bein' studied at the same time by somebody who had a knack at the\n",
      "business an' didn't have any reason to mean harm to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any one--any New Yorker, at least,--would have found Caleb an\n",
      "interesting subject,--don't you think so?\" said Mary, with a shy look\n",
      "of inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very sure that Philip and I did,\" Grace replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, 'twas all of Mrs. Somerton's doin', for she gave me a letter\n",
      "of introduction to Miss Mary Truett: the Lord reward her accordin' to\n",
      "her works, as the Apostle Paul said about Alexander the Coppersmith.\n",
      "I carried a lot of other letters, you'll remember, and every one to\n",
      "whom they were given was quite polite an' obligin'; but business is\n",
      "business, so as soon as the business was done, they were done with me.\n",
      "But Mary wasn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She wasn't allowed to be,\" Mary whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon that's so,\" Caleb admitted; \"for somehow I kept wantin' to\n",
      "hear the sound of her voice just once more--just to see what there was\n",
      "about it that made it so different from other voices, so I kept makin'\n",
      "business excuses that I thought were pretty clever an' reasonable-like,\n",
      "an' she was always good-natured enough to take 'em as they were meant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What else could she do?\" asked Mary, with an appealing look. \"The\n",
      "rules against personal acquaintances dropping into the store to chat\n",
      "were quite strict, and applied to heads of departments as well as to\n",
      "other employees. Caleb's plausible manner deceived no one, but he was\n",
      "so odd, at first, and so entertaining, that every one in authority in\n",
      "the store quickly learned to like him, and were glad to see him come\n",
      "in. They would make excuses to saunter near us, and listen to the\n",
      "conversation, and whenever he went out, some of them remained to tease\n",
      "me. They saw through him before I did, and made so much of what they\n",
      "saw that, in the course of time, I had to work hard to rally myself\n",
      "whenever I saw Caleb approaching.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She did it splendidly, too,\" said Caleb. \"In a little while I got so\n",
      "that my eye could catch her the minute I found myself inside the store,\n",
      "no matter how many people were between us, yet I'm middlin' short, as\n",
      "you know, an' she isn't tall. She'd be talkin' business, as sober as\n",
      "a judge, with somebody, but by the time I got pretty nigh, her face\n",
      "would look like a lot o' Mrs. Somerton's pet flowers--red roses, an'\n",
      "white roses, an' a couple o' rich pansies between, an' around 'em all\n",
      "a great tangle o' gold thread to keep 'em from gettin' away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb!\" exclaimed Mary. \"Your friends want only facts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he's giving us nothing else,\" Grace said, looking admiringly\n",
      "at Mary, while Philip added:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's doing it very nicely, too. Bravo, Caleb! Go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, she was kind o' curious about the West, like a good many other\n",
      "New Yorkers who hadn't ever been away from home, and one day she asked\n",
      "me if there was any chance out here for a young man who was a civil\n",
      "engineer and landscape architect. She said so much about the young\n",
      "man's smartness an' willingness, an' pluck, an' good nature, that\n",
      "all of a sudden I found myself kind o' hatin' that young man, an' it\n",
      "didn't take me long to find out why, an' when I saw that the trouble\n",
      "was that I was downright jealous of him, I said to myself, 'Caleb,\n",
      "you're an old fool,' an' I put in some good hard prayin' right then\n",
      "an' there. Suddenly she explained that the young man was her brother,\n",
      "an'--well, I reckon there never was a prayer bitten off shorter an'\n",
      "quicker than that prayer was. She wished he could meet me, an' I said\n",
      "that any brother o' hers could command me at any time an' anywhere, so\n",
      "we fixed it that I should call at their house that very evenin'. Well,\n",
      "I liked his looks an' his p'ints in general, an' he asked no end o' the\n",
      "right kind o' questions, an' she helped him. I told 'em ev'rythin',\n",
      "good an' bad--specially the latter--malaria, scattered population,\n",
      "bad roads, poor farming, poor clothes, scarcity of ready cash, all\n",
      "the houses small an' shabby; for up to that time it seemed to me that\n",
      "everybody in New York lived in a palace an' wore Sunday clothes ev'ry\n",
      "day of the week; afterwards I went about with some city missionaries\n",
      "an' policemen, an' came to the conclusion that the poorest man in this\n",
      "town an' county is rich, compared with more than half of the people in\n",
      "New York. But that's gettin' over the fence an' into another field.\n",
      "Her brother was so interested that nothin' would do but that I should\n",
      "go back an' take supper with 'em next evenin' an' continue the talk.\n",
      "Well, 'Barkis was willin',' as a chap in one of your circulatin'\n",
      "library books said. Pity that library's burned; I'll put up half the\n",
      "expense of a new one, for if ever there was a means of grace--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be replaced,\" said Philip, \"but--one means of grace at a\n",
      "time. Do go back to the original story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! Well, the next day happened to be the one in which I met my old\n",
      "army chum, Jim, who reconstructed me in the way I wrote you about. One\n",
      "consequence of Jim's over-haulin' was that when I got to their house\n",
      "an' walked into their parlor, they didn't know me from Adam; both of\n",
      "'em stood there, like a couple o' stuck pigs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What an elegant expression!\" exclaimed Mary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't say that as if you b'lieved it over an' above hard, my dear,\n",
      "but I do assure you that the expression means a lot to Western people.\n",
      "Pretty soon her brother came to himself an' asked what had happened,\n",
      "an' I said, 'Oh, nothin', except that when I'm in Turkey, an' likely to\n",
      "stay awhile, I try to do as the turkeys do.' Well, things kept goin'\n",
      "on, about that way, for some days, an' between thinkin' 'twas time\n",
      "for that corn-meal to come, an' wishin' that it wasn't, an' wishin' a\n",
      "lot of other things, I was in quite a state o' mind for a while, an'\n",
      "self-examination didn't help me much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the time there kep' runnin' in my mind an old sayin' that your\n",
      "Uncle Jethro was mighty fond of--'There's only one hoss in the world,'\n",
      "an' the most I could do to keep from bein' a plumb fool was to remind\n",
      "myself that that sort of a hoss had some rights of its own that\n",
      "ought to be respected. I showed off my own good p'ints as well as I\n",
      "could, an' I coaxed Mary to go about with me considerable, because\n",
      "Mrs. Somerton had told me that her judgment and taste were remarkably\n",
      "good,--that's the excuse I made,--an' we talked about a lot o' things,\n",
      "an' found we didn't disagree about much. I accidentally let out what I\n",
      "was goin' to England for, an' she got powerful interested in it, for\n",
      "she'd read an' heard lots about the way the poorest English live in big\n",
      "cities, so she thought I was really goin' on missionary work, an' she\n",

      "job.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She looked so splendid when she said it that I felt plumb\n",
      "electrified--felt just as if a new nerve had suddenly been put into me\n",
      "some way, so I made bold to say that she'd do that sort o' work far\n",
      "better as a woman, an' that there was a way for her to do it, too, if\n",
      "she was willin', an' if her minister would say a few words appropriate\n",
      "to that kind of arrangement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is exactly the way he spoke,\" said Mary, \"and as coolly as if he\n",

      "as if Judgment Day had come, an' I'd been roped off among the goats.\n",
      "But all of a sudden she turned rosy, an' said, very gentle-like an'\n",
      "sweet, ''Tis a long way to London, an' you might change your mind on\n",
      "the way.' Said I, ''Tis longer to eternity, but I'll be of the same\n",
      "mind till then, an' after, too.' She was kind o' skittish for a while\n",
      "after that, but she didn't do any kickin', which I took for a good\n",
      "sign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kicking, indeed!\" said Mary, studying the decoration of her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, at last she said she thought it might be better for me to go\n",
      "alone, so both of us could have a fair chance to think it over, an' I\n",
      "said that I wouldn't presume to doubt the good sense of whatever she\n",
      "thought, an' that her will was law to me, an' would go on bein' so as\n",
      "long as she would let it. Just then the corn-meal came, an' I went.\n",
      "After I got fairly started on the trip, I found myself feelin' kind o'\n",
      "glad she wasn't with me. As we've just been eatin' breakfast, I won't\n",
      "go into particulars; but after I got over bein' seasick, I felt as well\n",
      "an' strong as a giant, an' I ran a private prayer an' praise meetin'\n",
      "all the way across. At first I was sorry that I hadn't asked her for\n",
      "her picture to take along, but I soon found that I had one--had it in\n",
      "both eyes, day an' night, an' all the time I was in London, too, an'\n",

      "\n",
      "\"This bein' Sunday, I won't say anythin' more about the business than\n",
      "that I got it started well, didn't slight it, an' left it in good\n",
      "hands. Gettin' back to the United States appeared to take a year; I\n",
      "used to look at as much as a passenger could see of the engine, an'\n",
      "wish I could put my heart into it to make it work faster. One day we\n",
      "reached New York about sundown, an' I s'pose I needn't say whose house\n",
      "I made for at once, with my heart in my mouth. 'Twasn't hard to make\n",
      "out that she wasn't a bit sorry to see me, so my heart got out of my\n",
      "mouth at once, an' gave my tongue a change. She asked about my trip,\n",
      "an' told me about her letter to you about her brother, an' about your\n",
      "kind invitation to him, an' how busy he already was in Claybanks, an'\n",
      "she was able to tell me a lot about both of you, all of which I was\n",
      "mighty glad to hear, but after a while there came a kind o' silent\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Speakin' about thinkin' it over, I've been doin' nothin' else, an' I\n",

      "for about a million hours, it seemed to me, but at last she put out\n",

      "\"Blushes are very becoming to you, Caleb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you--very much. But how do you s'pose I felt next mornin' after\n",
      "wakin' up with the feelin' that this world was Paradise, an' that it\n",
      "couldn't be true that there were such things as sin an' sorrow an'\n",
      "trouble, an' then seein' the whole front of my mornin' paper covered\n",
      "with the Claybanks cyclone, an' nothin' to tell who was killed an' who\n",
      "was spared! 'Twas nigh on to seven o'clock when I saw the news, an'\n",
      "for a few minutes I did the hardest, fastest thinkin' I ever did in my\n",
      "life. I sent you a despatch, hopin' that you were among the saved, an'\n",
      "by eight o'clock I was at Mary's house. She'd seen the paper, so she\n",
      "wasn't surprised to see me. She was just startin' for the store, so I\n",
      "walked along with her, an' I said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It couldn't have come at a more awful time, so far as my feelin's are\n",
      "concerned, but the Claybanks people are my own people, after a fashion,\n",
      "an' some of 'em need me--that is, they'll get along better if they have\n",
      "me to talk to for a while. Will you forgive me if I hurry out to them?\n",
      "You won't think me neglectful, or less loving than I've promised to be,\n",
      "will you?' Then what did that blessed woman do but quote Scripture at\n",
      "me--'Whither thou goest I will go, an' where thou lodgest I will lodge,\n",
      "and thy people shall be my people.' 'Twas a moment or two before I took\n",
      "it all in; then I said, to make sure that I wasn't dreamin', 'Do you\n",
      "mean that you'll marry me--to-day--an' go out to Claybanks with me by\n",
      "this evenin's train?' An' she said, 'Could I have said it plainer?' By\n",

      "\"All right, my dear; I won't say it. I didn't know, until afterward,\n",

      "my supposed doin's for some of the folks out here. I don't doubt that\n",
      "those stories were powerful influential in bringin' things to a head.\n",
      "Well, while she went to the store to give notice to quit, an' to have a\n",
      "fuss, perhaps, all on my account, I went to a newspaper office to find\n",
      "out if any more news had come since daylight began. I wanted to know\n",
      "the worst, whatever it was, an' when they told me that nobody was dead,\n",
      "so far as could be learned, I wanted to wipe up part of the floor of\n",
      "that newspaper office with my knees, an' I didn't care a continental\n",
      "who might see me do it, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I went down to her store, an' got a word with her, though she was\n",
      "rattlin' busy. Queer, though, how sharp-eyed some of those New Yorkers\n",
      "are. Mary hadn't had a bit of trouble. The firm wasn't surprised when\n",
      "she began to make her little statement--they said they'd seen, a month\n",
      "or two before, how matters were likely to go, so they'd selected her\n",
      "successor, sorry though they were at the idea of losing her. They\n",
      "hadn't supposed the notice to quit would be so sudden, but after they\n",
      "compared notes about the front page of a mornin' paper they agreed that\n",
      "they'd be likely to lose Mary as soon as I struck New York. I s'posed\n",
      "men as busy as the owners of such a business would have forgotten\n",
      "the name of Claybanks, if they'd ever heard it, an' I wouldn't have\n",
      "supposed that they'd ever have heard anythin' about me; but bless you,\n",
      "they knew it all, an' they took Mary's words out of her mouth, as soon\n",
      "as she explained that a dear friend who had just arrived from Europe\n",
      "needed her companionship and assistance in a trip to the West. 'We hope\n",
      "Mr. Wright isn't ill,' said one of the partners, an' the other said,\n",
      "'We greatly hope so, for we learn from the Commercial Agency that he\n",
      "is really as prominent and useful a man as there is in his county.'\n",
      "Think o' that,--not that the Agency, whatever it is, was right, but\n",
      "think of me bein' on record in any way in New York, an' of those old\n",
      "chaps havin' known all about Mary an' me! It's plain enough that New\n",
      "York folks are as keen-eyed as the best, an' that they've got one thing\n",
      "that we Westerners don't know a single thing about, an' that's system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'm strayin' again. At the store I arranged with her that we\n",

      "after leavin' the store I got your despatch, which I didn't doubt had\n",
      "already been read up in heaven--bless you both! It didn't take more\n",
      "than two hours to duplicate the orders of a few weeks before; then I\n",
      "went to her house, for the last time, an' she was already dressed for\n",
      "the weddin'--dressed just as she is now. There were a couple of hours\n",
      "to spare, an' as I'd ordered our railroad tickets, I improved the time\n",
      "by tryin' to persuade her relatives, who had been called in on short\n",
      "notice, that she was goin' to be in safe hands. But there wasn't a\n",
      "chance to talk more'n two minutes at a time, for the door-bell kept\n",
      "ringin', an' messengers kept comin' in with flowers an' presents,\n",
      "most of 'em from people at the store. There's two trunks full of 'em,\n",
      "comin' along by express. Of course we were goin' to have a quiet\n",
      "weddin'--nobody invited to the church but her fam'ly an' two or three\n",
      "of her relatives, an' my old army chum Jim; but when we got there, a\n",
      "whole lot of folks were inside the church, an' when we started out\n",
      "after the ceremony they crowded to the aisle, an' some threw flowers\n",
      "in it, an' then for the first time the dear little woman learned that\n",
      "the store people had turned out in force, the proprietors among 'em,\n",
      "an' all the women kissed the bride, an' a lot of 'em cried, an'--oh,\n",
      "nobody ever saw such goin's on at any weddin' in the Claybanks church.\n",
      "An'--to wind up the story--here we are, ready for business, when Monday\n",
      "comes. I telegraphed Black Sam to find an empty house for us somewhere,\n",
      "knowin' that my old room was gone, an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're to live with us,\" said Philip. \"You know we've room to spare,\n",
      "and I know that my wife will be delighted to have your wife with her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, Philip. Mrs. Somerton's taste in women is as correct as in\n",
      "everythin' else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But doesn't your brother know?\" asked Grace of Mary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" was the reply. \"Some things are easier told than written.\n",
      "Besides, he's the dearest brother in the world, and thinks whatever I\n",
      "do is right. How I long to see him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll find him at once,\" said Philip, rising. \"'Twas very thoughtless\n",
      "of me to have neglected him so long, but between astonishment and\n",
      "delight I--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You won't have far to look,\" said Caleb, who had moved toward the\n",
      "window. \"Mary, come here, please--stand right beside me--close--to\n",
      "protect me in case he offers to knock me down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip opened the door, and Truett said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've just heard that Caleb came over from the railway station this\n",
      "morning. Has he--oh, Mary! Just as I might have expected, if I hadn't\n",
      "been too busy to think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't act as if you had any ill feelin' toward me,\" said Caleb,\n",
      "as Truett, after much affectionate demonstration toward his sister,\n",
      "greeted his brother-in-law warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ill feeling? I'm delighted--quite as much delighted as surprised. I\n",
      "saw how 'twould be before you sailed, for my sister has always been\n",
      "transparent to me. As to you, any one who saw you in Mary's presence\n",
      "could see what was on your mind. That was why I came out here. There\n",
      "were other places I might have selected for my own purposes, but when I\n",
      "saw how matters were going, I was determined that the town in which my\n",
      "sister was to live, in the course of time, shouldn't be malarious and\n",
      "shabby and slow if I could do anything to better it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" said Philip, with the manner of a man upon whom a new light had\n",
      "suddenly shone. \"Now I understand your rage for local improvements, and\n",
      "your Western fever in all its phases.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could I have had better cause?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip looked admiringly at Mary, and answered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was cleared by so many hands that they were in the way of one\n",
      "another; then the quintet adjourned to the windward side of the house,\n",
      "under the vine-clad arbor, and began to exchange questions. Suddenly\n",
      "Grace said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's something new and strange about Caleb--something besides his\n",
      "change of appearance and his happiness, and I can't discover what it\n",
      "is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" said Mary, with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, \"'tis his\n",
      "grammar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Caleb's eyes expressed solicitude as they turned toward Grace, and\n",
      "they indicated great sense of relief when Grace clapped her hands and\n",
      "exclaimed:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Caleb, \"it does me good to know that the change is big\n",
      "enough to see, for it's taken a powerful lot o' work. I used to be at\n",
      "the head of the grammar class when I was a boy at school, but 'Evil\n",
      "communications corrupt good manners,' as the Bible says, an' I've\n",
      "been hearin' the language twisted ev'ry which way ever since I left\n",
      "school. I never noticed that anythin' was wrong till I got into some\n",
      "long talks with Mary, an' even then I didn't suppose that 'twas my\n",
      "manner o' speech that once in a while made her twitch as if a skeeter\n",
      "had suddenly made himself too familiar. One evenin'--I didn't know\n",
      "till afterwards that she'd had an extra hard day at the store, an' had\n",
      "brought a nervous headache home with her--she gave an awful twitch\n",
      "while I was talkin', an' then she whispered 'Them!' to herself, an'\n",
      "looked as disapprovin' as a minister at a street-fight. Then all of a\n",
      "sudden my bad grammar came before my eyes, as awful as conviction to a\n",
      "sinner. But I was tryin' to set my best foot forward, so I went on:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I said \"them\" for \"those\" just now, perhaps you noticed?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I believe I did,' said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Well,' said I, 'that word was pounded into me so hard at school one\n",
      "day that I've never been able to get rid of it. You see, I was the\n",
      "teacher's favorite, after a fashion, because it was known that I was\n",
      "expectin' to study for the ministry, so the teacher kept remindin'\n",
      "me that grammar was made to practise as well as recite, an' 'twasn't\n",
      "of any use to use the language correctly in the class if I was goin'\n",
      "to smash it an' trample on the pieces on the playground. I took the\n",
      "warnin' an' one day, when four of us boys were havin' a game of\n",
      "long-taw at recess I said somethin' about \"those\" marbles. One of the\n",
      "boys jumped as if he had been shot, and when he came down he rolled\n",
      "back his lips an' said \"Those!\" kind o' contemptuous-like, an' another\n",
      "snickered \"Those!\" an' the other growled \"Those!\" an' then the first\n",
      "one said, \"Fellers, Preachy's puttin' on airs; let's knock 'em out of\n",
      "him,\" an' then all of 'em jumped on me an' pounded me until the bell\n",
      "rang us in from recess, an' from that time to this I've stuck to \"them\"\n",
      "like a penitent to the precious promises.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, she had a laugh over that; she said afterward that it cured her\n",
      "headache, but after quietin' down she said, lookin' out o' the side o'\n",
      "her face kind o' teasin'-like, an' also mighty bewitchin':--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'What did the boys do to make you say \"ain't\" for \"haven't\"?'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I was stuck, an' laughed at myself as the best way of turnin'\n",
      "it off, but for the rest of the evenin' I was chasin' the old grammar\n",
      "back through about twenty years of army talk an' store talk, an' 'twas\n",
      "harder than a dog nosin' a rabbit through a lot full o' blackberry\n",
      "patches, an' I reckon I lost the scent a good many times. I stayed in\n",
      "the city that night, so as to get into a bookstore an' a grammar book\n",
      "early next mornin', an' I dived into that book ev'ry chance I got, in\n",
      "the hoss-cars an' ev'rywhere else, an' when I was on the ocean an'\n",
      "not sayin' my prayers, nor readin' the Bible, I was doin' only three\n",
      "things, an' generally doin' all of 'em at once,--thinkin' of Mary,\n",
      "keepin' my head an' shoulders up as my old soldier-chum Jim had made me\n",
      "promise to do, an' puttin' Claybanks English into decent grammatical\n",
      "shape. I tried to stop droppin' my 'g's' too, for she seemed to think\n",
      "they deserved a fightin' chance o' life, even if they did come in only\n",
      "on the tail-ends of words; I'd have got along fairly well at it, if it\n",
      "hadn't been for the English people, but some of them seem to hate a\n",
      "'g' at the end of a word as bad as if it was an 'h' at the beginnin',\n",
      "which is sayin' a good deal. But see here, isn't it most church time? I\n",
      "s'pose the sooner I take up my cross, the less I'll dread it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb,\" exclaimed Grace, in genuine surprise, \"it can't be possible\n",
      "that you've been backsliding, and learning to dislike religious\n",
      "services?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" Caleb replied, looking quizzically at his wife; \"but you're\n",
      "the only old acquaintances I've met since I was married, an' at church\n",
      "I'll meet two or three hundred, an' Claybanks people don't often have\n",
      "any one new to look at an' talk about, an' any surprise of that kind is\n",
      "likely to hit most of 'em powerful hard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go very early,\" Grace suggested, \"and sit as far front as possible.\n",
      "Philip and I will break the news to the minister before he reaches the\n",
      "church, and we'll stand outside and tell the people as they arrive, so\n",
      "that they can collect their wits and manners by the time the service\n",
      "ends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That'll be a great help,\" said Caleb. Then he drew Grace aside and\n",
      "whispered with a look that was pathetic in its appeal: \"Try to make her\n",
      "understand, won't you, that our folks are a good deal nicer than they\n",
      "look? You went through it alone, a few months ago. I saw your face, an'\n",
      "my heart ached for you, but to-day I'm tremblin' for Mary. What do you\n",
      "s'pose she'll think after she's looked around?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About what I myself did,\" Grace replied. \"I thought, 'I've my\n",
      "husband,' and from that moment Philip was far dearer to me than he had\n",
      "been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that so? Glory! Mary, put on your bonnet. Let's be off for church.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "XXV--LOOKING AHEAD\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"WELL, Philip,\" said Caleb, as the two men met on the piazza before\n",
      "sunrise Monday morning, \"as Sunday's gone an' as there's no one here\n",
      "but you an' I, let's talk business a little bit. You mustn't think that\n",
      "my having taken a wife is going to make me an extra drag on you, an'\n",
      "right after a cyclone, too. My salary's enough to support two on the\n",
      "best that Claybanks can provide, an' if you're hard pushed, I can get\n",
      "along without drawin' anythin' for a year, for I've always kept a few\n",
      "hundred ahead against a time when I might break down entirely. I've\n",
      "told Mary how your wife's been in the store a great part of the time,\n",
      "an' there's nothin' that Mary'd like better than to do the same thing,\n",
      "if agreeable to you an' Mrs. Somerton. She's had practical trainin' at\n",
      "it, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She'll be worth her weight in gold to us,\" Philip replied, \"for\n",
      "I foresee a busy future, about which I've much to say to you. The\n",
      "cyclone, instead of depressing the people, seems to have nerved them\n",
      "to new hope, for the town has received much free advertising; a lot\n",
      "of city newspapers sent men down here to describe the horrors of\n",
      "the affair, and as there were no actual horrors, and the men wanted\n",
      "something of which to make stories, that brother-in-law of yours, who\n",
      "is about as quick-witted a young chap as I ever met, filled their heads\n",
      "with the natural resources of Claybanks,--rich soil, drained swamps,\n",
      "plenty of valuable commercial timber, water-power available at short\n",
      "notice, whenever manufacturers might demand it, and, of course, the\n",
      "great deposit of brick clay from which the town got its name. I predict\n",
      "that there will be a lot of chances to make money outside of the store,\n",
      "so the more help we can have in the store, the better. By the way,\n",
      "I wonder what Truett has been up to this morning. I heard hammering\n",
      "awhile ago, in the direction of the warehouse. Ah! I remember--putting\n",
      "up the old sign over the door--uncle's old sign; it was carried about\n",
      "a mile from town by the cyclone and brought back by a man who thought,\n",
      "and very correctly, that I'd like to preserve it. Let's go around a\n",
      "moment and see how it looks, and remind ourselves of old times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As they reached the front of the warehouse, Caleb lost the end of a\n",
      "partly uttered sentence, for over the old sign he saw a long board on\n",
      "which was painted, in large, black letters:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    SOMERTON & WRIGHT,\n",
      "\n",
      "    SUCCESSORS TO\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who did that?\" Caleb gasped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truett,\" Philip replied. \"He did it by special request, and I'm afraid\n",
      "he worked a little on Sunday, but Mrs. Somerton and I thought it a work\n",
      "of necessity. You see,\" Philip continued, in a matter-of-fact manner,\n",
      "and ignoring Caleb's astonished look, \"by the terms of Uncle Jethro's\n",
      "will I was to provide for you for life and to your own satisfaction,\n",
      "and 'tis quite as easy to do it this way as on the salary basis.\n",
      "Besides, 'twill put those benevolent societies out of their misery,\n",
      "and put an end to their questions, every two or three months, as to\n",
      "the likelihood of the property reverting to them. You'll have me in\n",
      "your power as to terms, but I know you'll do nothing unfair. Let's have\n",
      "articles of co-partnership drawn up, on the basis of equal division of\n",
      "profits in the entire business--store, farms, houses, etc. I wrote you\n",
      "of the lump of money I got for my father's old mining stock. That, of\n",
      "course, is my own; but if the firm runs short of ready cash at any time\n",
      "I will lend to it at the legal rate of interest, so nothing but a very\n",
      "bad crop year can cripple us. Besides, I shall want to operate a little\n",
      "on the outside, so the store will need an additional manager who shall\n",
      "also be an owner--not a clerk, as you've insisted on being.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Philip,\" said Caleb, who had collapsed on an empty box in front\n",
      "of the store, \"I've never had any experience as a boss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor as a married man, either,\" Philip replied, \"yet you've suddenly\n",
      "taken to the part quite naturally and creditably! The main facts are\n",
      "these: I'm satisfied that the past success of the store business has\n",
      "been due quite as much to you as to Uncle Jethro, and all the people\n",
      "agree with me. I couldn't possibly get along without you, nor feel\n",
      "honest if I continued to take more than half of the proceeds. Why not\n",
      "go tell the story to your wife, as an eye-opener? I think it might give\n",
      "her a good appetite for breakfast, and improve her opinion of Claybanks\n",
      "and the general outlook. It might cheer her farther to be told that her\n",
      "brother is the right man in the right place, and bids fair to become\n",
      "the busiest man in the county.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell her, an' I don't doubt that 'twill set her up amazingly.\n",
      "But, Philip--\" here Caleb looked embarrassed, \"you haven't--don't you\n",
      "think you could make out to say somethin' to me about her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You dear old chap,--'young chap' would be the proper\n",
      "expression,--where are your eyes, that you haven't seen me admiring her\n",
      "ever since you brought her to us yesterday morning? She's a beauty with\n",
      "a lot of soul, and she's a wonderfully clever, charming woman besides,\n",
      "and I never saw a bride who seemed deeper in love. I can't ever thank\n",
      "you enough for finding such capital company for my wife. I expected to\n",
      "be impressed, for Grace has raved about her ever since you first wrote\n",
      "of meeting her, but Grace left much untold.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid you might think she took up with me too easily,\" said\n",
      "Caleb; \"but when, after we were married, I told her I never would\n",
      "forgive myself if I did not make her life very happy, she said she\n",
      "had no fears for the future, and that I mustn't think she took me\n",
      "only on my own say-so, for she'd had a lot of letters from your wife\n",
      "about me, all to the effect that I was the honestest, kindliest, most\n",
      "thoughtful, most unselfish man in the world, except you. Mary had great\n",
      "confidence in the judgment of your wife, whom she remembered as a very\n",
      "discreet young woman and a good judge of human nature. Her brother,\n",
      "too, unloaded on her a lot of complimentary things that he'd managed to\n",
      "pick up out here about me. Now, as a married man, an' a good friend of\n",
      "mine, what do you honestly think of my future?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing but what is good. You've still half of your life before you,\n",
      "and if you're really rid of malaria, and if that Confederate bullet\n",
      "will cease troubling you, you ought to tread on air and live on\n",
      "sunshine for the remainder of your days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speakin' of bullets,\" said Caleb, tugging at one end of a double\n",
      "watch-chain, and extracting from his pocket something which resembled\n",
      "a battered button, \"how's that, for the wicked ceasin' from troublin'\n",
      "an' the weary bein' at rest? For my first two or three days at sea I\n",
      "couldn't see any good in sea-sickness, except perhaps that it had a\n",
      "tendency to make a man willin' to die, an' even that view of it didn't\n",
      "appeal very strongly to me, circumstances bein' what they were. One day\n",
      "when I was racked almost to death, I felt an awful stitch in my side. I\n",
      "was weak an' scared enough to b'lieve almost anythin' awful, so I made\n",
      "up my mind that I must have broken a rib durin' my struggles with my\n",
      "interior department, an' that the free end of it was tryin' to punch\n",
      "its way through to daylight. So I sent for the ship's surgeon, an' he,\n",
      "after fussin' over me two or three minutes, and doin' a little job of\n",
      "carvin', brought us face to face--I an' my old acquaintance from the\n",
      "South. I was so glad that I could 'a' hugged the Johnny Reb that fired\n",
      "that bullet, an' I never was seasick after that. But that's enough\n",
      "about me. Tell me somethin' about business. Do you think the cyclone\n",
      "has hurt you a lot, for the present?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It destroyed the store and its contents, and I don't expect to get\n",
      "any insurance, but I haven't lost any customers. On the other hand,\n",
      "some farmers are so sorry for me, I being the only merchant that was\n",
      "entirely cleaned out, that they are going to trade with us next year.\n",
      "Besides, much of our stock was old, and never would have sold at any\n",
      "price, while an entirely new stock is a great attraction to all classes\n",
      "of customers. We'll have a new store building up pretty soon, if Truett\n",
      "is as able as he thinks himself and as I think him. Let's go back to\n",
      "the wreck a moment; he generally has some men at work by sunrise,\n",
      "clearing away, so as to get at the foundations and ascertain their\n",
      "condition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently the young engineer was amusing himself, for they found him\n",
      "hammering a brick into small bits and examining the fractured surfaces.\n",
      "As Philip and Caleb joined him, he said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a mystery. How on earth do you suppose this kind of brick got\n",
      "into Claybanks?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Easiest way in the world,\" Caleb replied, \"seein' 'twas made here.\n",
      "'Tisn't a good color, but, gentlemen, I saw whole houses on some o' the\n",
      "best streets in New York made of brick of about this color. They were\n",
      "better shaped, an' fancy-laid, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, Caleb,\" said Truett, excitedly, \"but do you mean to say\n",
      "that this brick was made here, in Claybanks, of Claybanks clay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the English of it,\" Caleb replied, \"an' all the bricks of all\n",
      "the chimneys an' fireplaces in the town are of the same clay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; they're red.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but that's because of one of Jethro's smartnesses. Wonderful man,\n",
      "Jethro Somerton was. The way of it was this: a newcomer here that\n",
      "wanted to put on some style, like he'd been used to in Pennsylvany,\n",
      "got your uncle to order enough red paint for him to cover a big new\n",
      "barn. Just 'fore the paint got here the barn was struck by lightnin',\n",
      "an' the new barn had to be of rough slabs, an' the man was glad enough\n",
      "to get 'em, too. Meanwhile Jethro was stuck with a big lot o' red\n",
      "paint, for nobody else felt forehanded enough to paint a barn. Jethro\n",
      "cogitated a spell, an' then he said quite frequent an' wherever he got\n",
      "a chance, that Claybanks was a sad, sombre-lookin' place; needed color,\n",
      "specially in winter, to make it look kind o' spruce-like. That set some\n",
      "few people to white-washin' their houses, an' when them that couldn't\n",
      "afford to do that much kind o' felt that some o' their neighbors were\n",
      "takin' the shine off of 'em, Jethro up an' said, 'Any man can afford\n",
      "to paint his chimney red, anyhow, an' a red chimney'll brighten up any\n",
      "house.' So, little by little at first, but afterwards all at a jump,\n",
      "he got rid o' that lot o' red paint, an' had to order more, an' in the\n",
      "course o' time it got to be the fashion, quite as much as wearin' hats\n",
      "out o' doors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That explains,\" said Truett, apparently relieved at mind, \"why I've\n",
      "not noticed the brick before. I've seen two or three foundation walls,\n",
      "but I supposed, from their color, that they were merely mud-stained.\n",
      "Now let me give you two men a great secret, on condition that you let\n",
      "me in on the ground floor of the business end of it. Brick of this\n",
      "quality and color, properly moulded and baked, is worth about three\n",
      "times as much as ordinary red brick: I'll get the exact figures within\n",
      "a few days. I know that there is money in sending it to New York, from\n",
      "no matter what distance. Some of it is used even in indoor decoration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whe--e--e--ew!\" whistled Philip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Je--ru--salem!\" ejaculated Caleb. \"To think that the clay has been\n",
      "here all these years without anybody knowing its real value!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could any one be expected to know about anything that existed in\n",
      "an out-of-the-way hole-in-the-ground like Claybanks?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sh--not so loud!\" said Philip. \"Such talk in any Western town is worse\n",
      "than treason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis reason, nevertheless. There might be a vein of gold here, but\n",
      "how could the world ever learn of it? Who owns the clay banks? Can't we\n",
      "get an option on them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They belong to the town, which charges a royalty of twenty-five cents\n",
      "per thousand bricks,\" said Caleb. \"They've brought less than a hundred\n",
      "dollars, thus far.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, this is dreadful!--splendid, I mean! A brick-making outfit isn't\n",
      "expensive, and fuel with which to burn the bricks is cheap. Can't we\n",
      "three organize a company, right here, in our hats or pockets, and get\n",
      "the start of any and all others in the business? 'Twill cost us about\n",
      "two dollars per thousand, I suppose, to haul the bricks to the railway\n",
      "station, but even then there will be a lot of money in the business. If\n",
      "we could have a railway--pshaw, men--Claybanks _must_ have a railway!\n",
      "I've selected several routes, in off-hand fashion, over the three miles\n",
      "of country between here and the nearest railway station; there would be\n",
      "absolutely no bridging to do, nor any grading worth mentioning, so the\n",
      "three miles could be built for thirty thousand dollars. Let's do it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truett,\" said Philip, impressively, \"go slow--very slow, or you'll\n",
      "have inflammation of the brain. Worse still, I shall have it. Caleb may\n",
      "escape, for he has the native Westerner's serene self-confidence in his\n",
      "own town and section; but I'm a Claybanker by adoption merely. First,\n",
      "you open a mine of wealth before our eyes, in the claybanks. Then you\n",
      "tempt us to make bricks for rich New Yorkers and others. Then you offer\n",
      "us a railway for thirty thousand dollars,--more money, to be sure,\n",
      "than could be raised here in thirty years,--and you do all this before\n",
      "breakfast on Monday morning. Come into the house with us; I shall faint\n",
      "with excitement if I don't get a cup of coffee at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Make light of it, if you like,\" said Truett, \"but will you look at the\n",
      "brick-making figures,--cost of plant, manufacture, and freight, also\n",
      "the selling price,--if I can get them from trustworthy sources?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I will--our firm will; won't we, Caleb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been wantin' for years to see such a lot of figures,\" said Caleb,\n",
      "placidly, \"an' to see the railroad figures we could touch. I've seen\n",
      "some of the other kind, once in a while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope too many cooks haven't spoiled the broth,\" said Mary, at the\n",
      "breakfast table, from behind a large breast-knot of roses. \"I found in\n",
      "the garden what Grace pronounces a lot of weeds; but I've made a salad\n",
      "of them, and I shall feel greatly mortified if all of you don't enjoy\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are prepared to expect almost anything delightful from what has\n",
      "been accounted worthless,\" said Philip, \"after having listened to some\n",
      "of your brother's disclosures this morning. Eh, Caleb?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" replied Caleb, with an \"I-told-you-so\" air. \"I never\n",
      "doubted that a lot of good things would be developed at Claybanks, when\n",
      "the right person came along to develop 'em.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think of it, Mary!\" said Truett. \"You remember that magnificent house\n",
      "of old Billion's, on Madison Avenue--a house of yellowish brown brick?\n",
      "Well, the foundation of Somerton's old store is of just such brick,\n",
      "and it was made here, years ago, of the clay for which the town was\n",
      "named.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary's eyes opened wide as she replied:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a marvellous country! Why, Grace, one of our firm, at the old\n",
      "store, boasted of having a chimney breast of that same brick, as if it\n",
      "were something quite rare and costly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why don't you build the new store of it, Phil?\" Grace asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a happy thought!\" said Truett. \"Now, Somerton, what do you say\n",
      "to my brickyard plan? Put up the first solid building in Claybanks--set\n",
      "the fashion. Think of how 'twould advertise your business and make your\n",
      "competitors look small by comparison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well. See how quickly it can be done, if at all, and then we will\n",
      "talk business. We must have the warehouse clear by the beginning of the\n",
      "pork-packing season, less than four months distant.\" Then he smiled\n",
      "provokingly, and continued, \"Perhaps, however, it will be better to\n",
      "build the new store of wood, as already planned, so you can give most\n",
      "of your time to building a railroad, so that we may get our golden\n",
      "bricks, and other goods, to market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's sense in that,\" said Truett, taking the remark seriously.\n",
      "\"As to the road, you may rest assured that my figures are within the\n",
      "extreme cost.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear boy,\" said Philip, \"far be it from me to dispute an engineer's\n",
      "estimates; but for some years in New York I was clerk and correspondent\n",
      "for a firm of private bankers who dabbled in railways, and I assure you\n",
      "that they never found any that cost but ten thousand dollars per mile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps not, for most railways are built on credit--generally on\n",
      "speculation, and largely for the special benefit of the builders, but\n",
      "our road--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are these men talking about?\" Mary asked of Grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A railway from Claybanks to the nearest station we now have,\" said\n",
      "Philip. \"Women love imaginative creations, Truett, so tell them all\n",
      "about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There is no imagination in this,\" Truett retorted, \"but perhaps they\n",
      "will condescend to listen to facts. Most companies are obliged to\n",
      "average the cost of their lines over a great stretch of territory.\n",
      "They have bridges and trestles to build, cuts to make, low ground to\n",
      "fill, and they must pay high prices, at portions of their line, for\n",
      "right of way, and they stock and bond their companies at ruinous rates\n",
      "to get the necessary money. As I've already said, none of the routes I\n",
      "have selected requires a single bridge, trestle, or filling, and the\n",
      "right of way, at the highest prices of farm land in this county, won't\n",
      "exceed a thousand dollars per mile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Twon't cost a cent a mile,\" said Caleb. \"Any farmer in these parts\n",
      "will give a railroad free right of way through his land, and say 'Thank\n",
      "you' for the privilege of doing it. If his house or barn is in the way,\n",
      "he will move it; he'll even let the line run over his well, and dig\n",
      "himself a new one, for the sake of having railroad trains for him and\n",
      "his family to stare at, for the trains kind o' bring farmers in touch\n",
      "with the big world of which they never see anything. If everything else\n",
      "can be arranged, you may safely count on me to coax right of way for\n",
      "the entire line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Score one for Truett!\" said Philip; \"proceed, Mr. Engineer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, and thanks to Caleb. The items of cost will be only\n",
      "road-bed, ties, and metal. A single track, with heavy rails, can be\n",
      "metalled out here for less than three thousand dollars per mile: that\n",
      "means nine thousand dollars for the three miles, and that should be the\n",
      "total cash outlay, for the road-bed and ties can be provided, by local\n",
      "enterprise, without money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon my thick head,\" said Philip, \"but how?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By organizing a stock company with shares so small that any farmer can\n",
      "subscribe, his subscription being payable in ties, which he can cut\n",
      "from his own woodland, or in labor with pick, shovel, horses, plough,\n",
      "scraper--whatever he and we can best use. Fix a valuation on ties,\n",
      "and on each class of labor, and pay in stock. 'Tis simply applying\n",
      "our drainage-ditch plan to a larger operation, though not very much\n",
      "larger, and one that will be attractive to a far greater number of men.\n",
      "Do this, and you merchants and other men of money supply the cash to\n",
      "buy the metal, and I'll guarantee to have that road completed in time\n",
      "to haul to market your wheat, pork, corn, and other produce on any\n",
      "day of the coming winter, regardless of the weather. Caleb tells me\n",
      "that you merchants have often lost good chances of the market because\n",
      "the roads between here and the station were so soft or so rough that\n",
      "a loaded wagon couldn't get over them. There are tens of thousands of\n",
      "cords of firewood still standing here, on land that ought to be under\n",
      "cultivation, but the farmers have no incentive to cut it, for there is\n",
      "no market but this little town. The railroad would get it to market,\n",
      "and at good cash prices, and thus doubly benefit the farmers. I'm told\n",
      "that the water-power of the creek has been holding up the Claybanks\n",
      "heart for years; and I know that there are enough varieties of\n",
      "commercial timber here to occupy several mills a long time, but no one\n",
      "is going to haul machinery in, and his output away, over three miles of\n",
      "mud or frozen clods.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True as Gospel--every word of it,\" said Caleb. \"I've heard Jethro, an'\n",
      "Doc Taggess, an' ev'ry other level-headed man in town say the same\n",
      "thing for years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fully agree with them,\" said Philip, \"but let's go back to figures a\n",
      "moment. I've heard nothing yet about the cost of locomotives, and other\n",
      "rolling stock--mere trifles, of course,--yet necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should not be expected to supply them,\" Truett explained. \"The road\n",
      "which ours will feed will be glad to supply them, as all roads do for\n",
      "short spurs on which anything is to be handled. It would be idiotic to\n",
      "buy rolling stock for a road which at first won't have enough business\n",
      "to justify one train a day. When there's anything to do, the old\n",
      "company will send down a short train from the nearest siding; the run\n",
      "wouldn't require fifteen minutes. You Eastern people who are accustomed\n",
      "to a thickly populated country, with many through trains daily, don't\n",
      "know anything about the business methods of the sparsely settled\n",
      "portions of the West, especially on spurs of a railway line.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's right about rolling stock,\" said Caleb. \"Ten years ago the\n",
      "railroad company, over yonder, told Jethro an' a committee that went\n",
      "from here to see 'em that if we'd build the spur, they'd do the rest.\n",
      "But they stood out for a solid road-bed, as good as their own, an' for\n",
      "heavy steel rails, like their own, for they said their rollin' stock\n",
      "was very heavy, and they wa'n't goin' to take the risk of accidents.\n",
      "The price of the rails knocked us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Naturally,\" said Truett, \"for steel rails were four or six times as\n",
      "costly then as they are now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've made me too excited to eat,\" said Philip, leaving the table,\n",
      "\"and I'm afraid that the trouble will continue until this road is moved\n",
      "from the air to the ground. The main offices of the old company are\n",
      "only about a hundred miles away; suppose, Truett, that you and the most\n",
      "truly representative merchant of Claybanks--I mean Caleb--run up there?\n",
      "I'll look after the men at work on the store. Tell the president, or\n",
      "whoever is in authority, that we think of building a spur at once from\n",
      "here to their main track, see what they'll do, and persuade them to say\n",
      "it in black and white. If they talk favorably, we'll hold a public\n",
      "meeting, and try to do something. Mrs. Wright, we owe you an apology. I\n",
      "assure you that business talk is not the rule at our breakfast table.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish it were!\" said Mary, who, with Grace, had listened excitedly\n",
      "until both women were radiant with enthusiasm. \"I wish railways could\n",
      "be planned at breakfast every day--if my brother were to be the\n",
      "builder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mary,\" said Caleb, \"perhaps you begin to understand the Western\n",
      "fever of which I've told you something from time to time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Understand it?\" said Mary, dashing impulsively at her husband. \"I\n",
      "already have it--madly! I'm willing to bid you good-by at once for\n",
      "your trip, though I haven't been married a week. My husband a possible\n",
      "railway director--and yours also, Grace! How do you feel?\"\n",

      "had first packed several bricks and fragments of bricks, from the\n",
      "foundations of the old store, for shipment to New York, accompanied by\n",
      "a request for probable selling figures of brick of the same natural\n",
      "quality and properly made. He also wrote for an estimate of cost of a\n",

      "The two men returned within forty-eight hours with a written promise\n",
      "from the trunk line company to lay the rails, if these and a proper\n",

      "to take a lease of the road, when completed, by guaranteeing a six per\n",
      "cent dividend on the stock, which was not to exceed thirty thousand\n",
      "dollars. The company also imparted the verbal reminder that a six\n",

      "all it's worth; give ev'rybody a chance; then, if toward the end there\n",
      "shows up a deficiency, they'll be grateful to you for makin' it up. Do\n",
      "you want the earth? Quite likely; so remember what the Bible says, 'The\n",
      "meek shall inherit the earth,' by which I reckon it doesn't mean the\n",
      "small-spirited, but the men who don't set their feller-men agin 'em by\n",
      "pushin' themselves too far to the front. If folks here don't know that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Right--as usual, Caleb,\" said Philip, after some impatient pursing of\n",
      "his lips. \"I begin to see, however, in this guaranteed stock--provided,\n",
      "of course, that the farmers subscribe as freely as Truett's plan will\n",
      "allow--a way of relieving the stringency of ready money in this county.\n",
      "We may be able to start a small bank here in the course of time,\n",
      "especially if any manufacturers can be attracted by the hard woods, the\n",
      "railway, and the water-power.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "spendin', wisely or otherwise, clean up to his limit, an' then want\n",
      "money just as much as he did at first; but I'd like our farmers to have\n",

      "that evening, immediately after the closing hour, for a private and\n",
      "confidential talk on a business subject of general interest to the\n",
      "community. Caleb went into the farming district and invited a flour\n",
      "miller and several of the more intelligent farmers to attend the\n",
      "meeting. At the appointed hour every one was present, the door was\n",
      "locked, Philip briefly outlined the railway scheme, told of the main\n",
      "line company's offer, and called upon Truett to detail his plan of\n",
      "construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young engineer responded promptly with facts and figures, and\n",
      "made much of his proposed stock subscriptions to be paid for in labor\n",
      "and ties, and the farmers present declared it entirely feasible. Most\n",
      "of the merchants were frightened at the amount of cash that would\n",
      "be required for rails, etc., as almost all of it would have to be\n",
      "subscribed by them; but Philip, backed by the consciousness of his\n",
      "own bank deposit in the East, assured them that through some Eastern\n",
      "acquaintances he could get merchants' short notes discounted for a\n",
      "large part of their subscriptions, and that the guaranteed stock could\n",
      "be sold or borrowed on as soon as issued; if the cutting and delivery\n",
      "of ties could begin at once, the road could be completed soon enough\n",
      "to get the autumn and winter produce to market almost as rapidly as it\n",
      "could be brought in.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage of the proceedings the owner of the saw-mill promised to\n",
      "expedite matters by subscribing five hundred dollars' worth of stock,\n",
      "payable in ties at a fair price. The town's last railway excitement,\n",
      "several years before, had caused him to buy in a lot of small timber\n",
      "and saw it into ties, which had been dead stock ever since; he had even\n",
      "tried to sell them for firewood. Doctor Taggess thought so highly of\n",
      "the project that he said he would take a thousand dollars' worth of\n",
      "stock; he had very little ready money, but through family connections\n",
      "in the East he could raise the money by mortgaging his home. The\n",
      "county clerk said he would take five hundred dollars' worth, the\n",
      "hotel-keeper promised to take a similar amount, and the flour miller\n",
      "asked to be \"put down\" for two hundred and fifty. By this time the\n",
      "merchants lifted up their hearts and pledged enough more to secure\n",
      "the purchase of the metal. It was then resolved that a public meeting\n",
      "should be held within a week, at the court-house, roofless though it\n",
      "still was, and all participators in the private consultation agreed to\n",
      "\"boom\" the enterprise in the meantime to the best of their ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The public meeting was as enthusiastic and successful as could have\n",
      "been desired. Caleb had already secured the right of way, as promised,\n",
      "and a statement of this fact, added to those narrated above and\n",
      "repeated at the meeting, elicited great applause. Truett announced\n",
      "the valuations, estimated after much consultation, of the various\n",
      "kinds of labor to be received in payment of stock; also, the price\n",
      "of ties, and the length, breadth, thickness, and general quality of\n",
      "the ties desired. As the required number of ties was apparently in\n",
      "excess of the producing capacity of the local saw-mill and the farmers\n",
      "tributary to Claybanks, it was resolved that tie subscriptions should\n",
      "be solicited from the part of the county on the other side of the trunk\n",
      "line, and thus expand the blessings of stockholdership. Then a list\n",
      "of conditional subscriptions was opened, and it filled so rapidly,\n",
      "that before the meeting adjourned there appeared to be secured as much\n",
      "labor, money, and ties as would be needed; so a committee was appointed\n",
      "to organize the Claybanks Railway Company according to the laws of the\n",
      "state.\n",

      "\"Is it done--really done?\" asked Grace and Mary, like two excitable\n",

      "instrument and a lot of stakes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several farmers' wives at once offered the services of their own sons,\n",
      "and went in search of them, while two of the women, more \"advanced\"\n",
      "than the others, themselves volunteered to carry stakes, chains,\n",
      "etc.,--anything to hurry that blessed railroad into existence.\n",
      "Fortunately the arrival of several boys made the services of these\n",
      "patriotic ladies unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The sooner I am able to avail myself of any labor that may offer, the\n",
      "sooner I shall be ready for some of the ties. Oh, those ties! I wonder\n",
      "how many farmers and their sons I shall have to instruct in hewing!\"\n",
      "said Truett.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't waste any time in thought on that subject, if I were you,\"\n",
      "said Caleb; \"for what our farmers don't know about hewin' would take\n",
      "you or any other man a long time to find out. How do you s'pose all the\n",
      "beams an' standin' timbers of all the houses an' barns built in this\n",
      "county was made in the days before there were any saw-mills nearer\n",
      "than twenty miles? How do you s'pose some of the log houses here are\n",
      "so tight in the joints that they need no chinkin'? I've heard of some\n",
      "Eastern people bein' born with gold spoons in their mouths; well, it's\n",
      "just as true that hundreds of thousands of Westerners were born with\n",
      "axes in their hands. The axe was their only tool for years, an' they\n",
      "got handy enough with it to do 'most anythin', from buildin' a house to\n",
      "sharpenin' a lead-pencil!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good for Caleb!\" shouted a farmer's wife, and Truett made haste to\n",
      "say:--\n",

      "\"I apologize to the entire West, and will put my mind at ease about the\n",
      "ties.\"\n",

      "The subject of conversation was changed by an irruption of farmers\n",
      "and citizens, who wished to talk more about the new railroad, and\n",
      "who rightly thought that the place where the engineer could be found\n",
      "was the most likely source of information. The questions were almost\n",
      "innumerable, and Truett, who was quite as excited as any of them,\n",
      "told all he knew about what certain specified spur roads had done\n",
      "for farming and wooded districts no more promising than Claybanks; so\n",
      "the informal meeting became even more enthusiastic than the gathering\n",
      "at the court-house had been, for the farmers' wives added fuel to the\n",
      "flame. The spectacle impressed Grace deeply, well though she knew the\n",
      "people; for from most of the faces was banished, for the time being,\n",
      "the weary, resigned expression peculiar to a large portion of the\n",
      "farming population of the newer states. Caleb, too, long though he had\n",
      "known all the men and women in the throng, had his heart so entirely in\n",
      "his face that Grace whispered to Mary:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do look at your husband! Did you ever see him look so handsome, until\n",
      "to-day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong, warm, nervous hand-clasp was the only reply for a moment;\n",
      "then Mary whispered:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the men here are fine-looking!--their faces are so expressive!\n",
      "I've not noticed it until to-day. Where did Claybanks get such people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say all that to your husband, if you wish to fill his heart to\n",
      "overflowing,\" said Grace, \"and then, to please me, repeat it to Doctor\n",
      "Taggess, or tell both of them at once.\" To share in the enjoyment, she\n",
      "succeeded in getting Caleb and the Doctor close to her and Mary, and\n",
      "quoted to them:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Listen, my children, and you shall hear'--now, Mary!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't wonder that you're impressed,\" the Doctor replied, when Mary's\n",
      "outburst concluded. His own eyes were gleaming, and Mary said afterward\n",
      "that his face was her ideal of a hero at the moment of victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Mrs. Somerton, can you again wonder, as you've wondered aloud\n",
      "to my wife and me, that I, whom you've kindly called a man of high\n",
      "quality, have been content to pass my adult years among these backwoods\n",
      "people? Do see their hearts and souls come into their faces! I know\n",
      "they are not always so, but we never heard of any one remaining all the\n",
      "while on the Mount of Transfiguration. It isn't the railway alone that\n",
      "they're thinking of, but of what it will mean to themselves and their\n",
      "hard-working wives, and to their children,--closer touch with the great\n",
      "world of which they've read and wondered, better prices for their\n",
      "yield, which means more creature comforts at home, better educational\n",
      "facilities for their children, and less temptation for the children\n",
      "to escape from the farm to the city. They know that all this must be\n",
      "the work of time, but they've never before seen the beginning of it,\n",
      "so now they're building air-castles as rapidly as a lot of magicians\n",
      "in dream-land. I can't blame them, for I'm doing it myself, old and\n",
      "cautious though I am. They can wait for the end, so can I; for all of\n",
      "us, out here, have had long training in the art of waiting. At present\n",
      "the beginning is joy enough, for I can't imagine how any one about us\n",
      "could look happier.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The formal survey of the railway route began that afternoon, for the\n",
      "people would listen to no suggestions of delay. It was completed\n",
      "quickly, and that the company was not yet organized according to law\n",
      "did not prevent the immediate offer and acceptance of a large working\n",
      "force of men, boys, horses, etc., from the village itself. The young\n",
      "engineer was his own entire staff, and also temporary secretary and\n",
      "accountant of the enterprise; but as it was his first great job, he\n",
      "enjoyed the irregularity of everything. From that time forward, for\n",
      "several months, the village stores ceased to be lounging places. Any\n",
      "villager or farmer with time to spare made his way to the line of the\n",
      "new road, and feasted his eyes, apparently never to fulness, on the\n",

      "\n",
      "As the work progressed farther from the town, the farmers of the\n",
      "vicinity, with their families, would saunter toward the line on Sunday\n",
      "afternoons and linger for hours, talking of the good times that were\n",
      "coming, and some of them actually moved their houses as near to the\n",
      "track as possible, so that the inmates might be able to have the best\n",
      "possible view of the trains when they began to run. When the road-bed\n",
      "was made and the ties were placed, and the laying of the rails began,\n",
      "entire families picnicked for a day at a time beside the track,\n",
      "although the weather had become cold, merely to see a shabby locomotive\n",
      "push backward some platform cars loaded with rails, and to see the\n",
      "rails unloaded, and listen to the musical clamor of track-laying;\n",

      "work by Christmas, but the formal opening ceremonies took place on\n",
      "Thanksgiving Day; and more than half the people of the county took\n",
      "part in it. With an eye to business the principal stockholders--the\n",
      "Claybanks merchants--hired a passenger train for the day, and gave the\n",
      "natives free rides to and from the nearest station that had a siding\n",
      "and switch by which the train could be sent back. The station had not\n",
      "a great town to support it,--merely five thousand people,--but as the\n",
      "Claybankers roamed through the place and saw many houses finer than\n",
      "any house in Claybanks, several streets that were paved with wooden\n",
      "blocks and many that had sidewalks, saw the telegraph and telephone\n",
      "wires, and a bank, and a fire-engine house, and horse-troughs into\n",

      "general service, their hearts were filled with the conviction that all\n",
      "these comforts and conveniences had come through the possession of a\n",
      "railway. Claybanks was in a fair way to become like unto that town, and\n",
      "they made haste, each after his kind, to rejoice. Then all of them who\n",
      "were farmers began to lay out, on their mental tablets, the appearance\n",
      "of their own farms as they would be when divided into building lots,\n",
      "and also to count the pleasing sums of money that would be paid by the\n",

      "had Claybanks pork, and undoubtedly these products had entered into\n",
      "the physical constitution of New York to some extent, but they could\n",
      "not afterward be identified. Claybanks bricks, however, were very\n",

      "at each side of the pulpit for the sides of the open Bible to rest\n",

      "\"CALEB,\" said Philip one evening, as the partners and their wives sat\n",
      "in the parlor of the Somerton home and enjoyed the leisure hour that\n",
      "came between store-closing and bed-time, \"so much important business\n",
      "has been crowded into the past few months that some smaller ventures\n",
      "have almost escaped my mind. What ever came of that car-load of walnut\n",
      "stumps that I sent East last summer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't have told you much about it if you'd asked me a day\n",
      "earlier,\" Caleb replied. \"I turned it over to a man in the fine-woods\n",
      "business--a Grand Army comrade that I met at my old chum Jim's post.\n",
      "He said at the time that the stumps would undoubtedly pay expenses of\n",
      "diggin' and shipment, an' maybe a lot more, but 'twould depend entirely\n",
      "on the stumps themselves. He'd have each of 'em sawed lengthwise an'\n",
      "a surface section dressed, to show the markings of the grain o' the\n",
      "wood. It seems that they were so water-soaked that 'twas months after\n",
      "sawin' before the wood of any of 'em was dry enough to dress, but he\n",
      "got at some of 'em a few weeks ago, an' though most of 'em wa'n't\n",
      "above the ordinary, there were two or three that made the furniture\n",
      "an' decoration men bid against each other at a lively rate. One of 'em\n",
      "panned out over sixty dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? One walnut stump? Sixty dollars?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's nothing. To work me up, he told me of one, picked up in the\n",
      "country a few years ago, that brought more than a thousand dollars to\n",
      "the buyer. The markings were so fine that it was sawn into thin veneers\n",
      "that were sold for more than their weight in silver. Still, to come\n",
      "to the point, your entire lot brought about two hundred and seventy\n",
      "dollars net, an' I've got the check in my pocket to prove it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the land from which they were taken cost me only two hundred\n",
      "dollars in goods! And there are still hundreds of stumps in it! And I\n",
      "felt so ashamed and babyish when I learned that I'd been tricked into\n",
      "buying cleared land, that I almost resolved to recall you by wire, so\n",
      "that I should be kept from being tricked again in some similar manner!\n",
      "I shall have to drive out to old Weefer's farm, tell him the story, and\n",
      "ask him if he has any more walnut clearings for sale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hadn't you better keep quiet about it? Where's the use in killin'\n",
      "the goose that lays the golden egg? Pick up all the walnut clearin's\n",
      "that are for sale, an' make what you can out of 'em, before you go to\n",
      "talkin'; but if you feel that you must say somethin' on the subject\n",
      "to somebody, an' jubilate a little, go tell Doc Taggess, who owns the\n",
      "lot you thought you were buyin'. If anybody deserves to make money in\n",
      "the boom that's comin', Doc does, an' if he could clear his land, now\n",
      "that he can railroad the logs to market, an' then get out his stumps,\n",
      "he might get cash enough ahead to pick up a lot of real estate, or\n",
      "take stock in millin' enterprises, when the water-power ditch is made,\n",
      "an' so lay up somethin' to keep him out of the poor-house in old age;\n",
      "for as long as he can practise, he'll give to the poor all that he can\n",
      "collect from patients that are better off. The chap that handled the\n",
      "stumps for you asked me a lot of questions about the kind an' quantity\n",
      "of standin' timber out here, and said he didn't see why we didn't start\n",
      "mills to turn out furniture lumber an' dimension-stuff, like some that\n",
      "have made fortunes for men in the backwoods of Indiana and Michigan an'\n",
      "some other states.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's try it, if our cash and credit aren't already used as far as\n",
      "they should be. By the way, how is Claybanks corn-flour, Somerton's\n",
      "brand, going in England?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fairly. We've sent, in all, about four hundred barrels; that's an\n",
      "average of a hundred a month, with a net profit to us of about thirty\n",
      "per cent, which is better, I reckon, than any of the big flour shippers\n",
      "ever dreamed o' makin'. I've been hopin' that the good tidin's of good\n",
      "food-stuff at about half the price o' bad would work its way into other\n",
      "parts of London an' out into the country, too; but English people don't\n",
      "seem to move about an' swap stories an' prices, like us Americans.\n",
      "I reckon I came home too soon, for the good o' that deal, for I had\n",
      "a lot o' things in mind to do in London to make corn-meal popular.\n",
      "It seems to be the English way to let things alone until some of the\n",
      "upper classes take to 'em, so I was goin' to try the meal on some o'\n",
      "the swells; but the more I thought of it, the more it seemed that they\n",
      "too belonged to the follow-my-leader class. So I made up my mind to\n",
      "begin way up at the tip-top, an' so I wrote a letter to Queen Victoria,\n",
      "sayin' I'd come all the way from America to make the English people\n",
      "practically acquainted with the cheapest and most nutritious food known\n",
      "in the temperate zone, an' that I was catchin' on fairly, but the\n",
      "common people seemed to think it was common stuff, which it wasn't, as\n",
      "I would be glad to prove to her. Besides, I knew of Americans richer\n",
      "than any nobleman in England who had it on their tables every day. I\n",
      "said I could make six kinds o' bread an' three kinds o' puddin' out o'\n",
      "corn-meal, an' I'd like a chance to do it some day for her own table;\n",
      "if she'd let me do it in the palace kitchen, I'd bring my own pans an'\n",
      "things, so's not to put the help to any trouble,--an' I'd--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You--wrote--to--the Queen--of England,\" Philip exclaimed, \"offering to\n",
      "make corn-bread and meal-pudding for the royal table!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I did, an' I took pains to specify that 'twould be made\n",
      "of Claybanks corn-flour, Somerton's brand, too--not the common meal\n",
      "that again an' again has let down American corn in foreign minds to\n",
      "the level of the hog-trough. But it didn't work. Though I put in an\n",
      "addressed postal card for reply, the good lady never answered my\n",
      "letter. Too busy, I s'pose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Philip stared at Grace, who pressed one hand closely to her lips, while\n",
      "Mary looked at her husband as if wondering in what entirely original\n",
      "and unexpected manner, and where, he might next break out. Then Philip\n",
      "said gravely:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strange! Besides, I doubt whether any other man was ever so\n",
      "thoughtful as to enclose a reply-card to her Majesty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, after waitin' a spell I made up my mind that that particular\n",
      "cake was all dough. One day when I was in the shop, turnin' sample\n",
      "cakes an' bread out o' the pans, up drove a carriage, an' a couple o'\n",
      "well-dressed men, one of 'em short an' stout, an' the other kind o'\n",
      "tallish, came in an' looked about, kind o' cur'us. 'Try some samples,\n",
      "gentlemen?' said I, thinkin' they looked as if they was used enough to\n",
      "good feedin' to know it when they saw it. They nodded, stiffish-like,\n",
      "an' I set 'em down to a little table with a white cloth on it, an'\n",
      "I set before 'em dodgers, an' muffins, an' cracklin' bread, an'\n",
      "pan-cakes, all as hot as red pepper, an' some A 1 English butter to try\n",
      "'em with--an' they do know how to make butter over in England!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they sampled 'em all, takin' two or three mouthfuls of each,\n",
      "an' exchanged opinions, which seemed to be favorable, with their eyes\n",
      "an' heads. While they were eatin', the shop began to get dark, an'\n",
      "when I looked around to see if a fog had come up all of a-sudden, as\n",
      "it sometimes does over there, I saw that the street was packed with\n",
      "people, an' they were jammed up to the doors an' windows. 'It's plain\n",
      "that gentlemen are not often on exhibition in this part of the town,'\n",
      "said I to myself. Suddenly the two got up, an' both said 'Thanks,' an'\n",
      "went out, an' when their carriage started, the crowd set up a cheer.\n",
      "'Who are they?' I said to a man at the door. He looked at me as if I\n",
      "had tried to run a counterfeit on him, an' he said, 'Ah, me eye!' but\n",
      "another chap said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'It's the Prince, an' the Duke o' Somethinorother.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"H'm! Yet you never got a reply on that postal card!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never. I meant to try again, an' register the letter, so as to be\n",
      "sure that it got into the right hands, but somethin' kept tellin' me\n",
      "'twas time to get back home. But if you'll let me make a trip again\n",
      "next fall, at my own expense, I'll try for better luck. Anyway, I'll\n",
      "work the corn-meal plan on Liverpool an' other cities, an' if it\n",
      "takes as well as it's done in London, 'twon't be long before a good\n",
      "many thousan's of bushels of Claybanks corn'll be saved from the\n",
      "distilleries, in the course of a year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Phil,\" Grace remarked, \"Caleb's wish to go abroad in the fall reminds\n",
      "me that I want you to take me East for a few weeks in the spring, and\n",
      "we ought to begin our preparations at once. As 'tis near Christmas,\n",
      "Mary and I have been talking of presents, and particularly of one which\n",
      "you and Caleb can join in giving us and at the same time secure to\n",
      "yourselves more of the business and social companionship of your wives.\n",
      "We want a housekeeper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sensible women!\" Philip replied. \"As to your husbands, they will be\n",
      "delighted--eh, Caleb? If it weren't that servants can't be had in this\n",
      "part of the country, and help, after the Claybanks manner, would have\n",
      "banished all sense of privacy, I should think myself a villain of\n",
      "deepest dye for having allowed the wife of the principal merchant of\n",
      "Claybanks to cook my meals and do all the remaining work of the house,\n",
      "and I don't doubt that Caleb feels similarly about Mary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Caleb, \"work that wa'n't degradin' to my dear mother\n",
      "oughtn't to seem too mean for my wife; but, on the other hand, my\n",
      "mother shouldn't have done it if I could have helped it, 'specially if\n",
      "she'd have tried also to do a full day's clerk-work in a store once in\n",
      "ev'ry twenty-four hours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That explains our position,\" Grace added. \"You two men are so full of\n",
      "new business of various kinds that Mary and I should be in the store\n",
      "all the while. Soon that dreadful pork-house must open for the season,\n",
      "and then we shall see less of you than ever. A good housekeeper will\n",
      "cost no more than a good clerk, and we must have one or the other. We\n",
      "don't want a clerk, if we can avoid it; at present we have the business\n",
      "entirely in our own hands, and when there are no customers in the\n",
      "store, we have as much privacy and freedom as if we were in the house.\n",
      "Mary knows a good woman in New York who will be glad to come here as\n",
      "maid-of-all-work, if she may be called housekeeper instead of servant;\n",
      "she has a grown son who wishes to be a farmer and to begin where land\n",
      "is cheaper and richer than it is in the vicinity of New York. With such\n",
      "a woman to care for the house we can spend most of our time in the\n",
      "store, hold the trade of such womenfolk as deal with us, and try to\n",
      "get the remainder; for where women and their daughters buy, the husband\n",
      "and brothers will also go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's as sure as shootin',\" said Caleb. \"Do you know that in spite of\n",
      "the cyclone the store has done twice as much business since you came as\n",
      "it ever did before in the same months? I'd be downright sorry for the\n",
      "other merchants in town if I didn't believe that we're soon goin' to\n",
      "have a big increase of population, and there'll be business enough for\n",
      "all. Philip deserves credit for a lot of the new business, an' his wife\n",
      "for more, which isn't Philip's fault, but his fortune in havin' married\n",
      "just that sort of woman. If nobody else'll say it, I s'pose it won't be\n",
      "presumin' for me to say that a small percentage of the increase o' the\n",
      "last two or three months has come through a young woman whose name used\n",
      "to be Mary Truett.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Small percentage, indeed!\" Grace exclaimed. \"Mary has secured more new\n",
      "business than I did in the same number of weeks, and she has done it\n",
      "so easily, too. She never seems to be thinking of business when she's\n",
      "talking to a customer, yet she instinctively knows what each woman\n",
      "wants, and places the proper goods before her, while I, very likely,\n",
      "would be thinking more of the woman than of the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's merely a result of experience,\" said Mary. \"I'm nearly thirty,\n",
      "with a business experience of ten years; you were a mere chit of\n",
      "twenty-three when you married. Still, I don't believe any hired clerk,\n",
      "of no matter how many years' experience, could do half as well as\n",
      "either of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the very good reason,\" said Philip, \"that both of you are\n",
      "practically owners of the business. No clerk can be as useful in any\n",
      "business as one of the proprietors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That remark would 'a' hurt my feelin's, a year ago,\" said Caleb;\n",
      "\"but since my name went on that sign over the door, I've been lookin'\n",
      "backward at my old self a lot, an' lookin' down on my old self, too.\n",
      "Perhaps the difference has come o' gettin' rid o' malaria, perhaps\n",
      "o' takin' a wife; but I'm goin' to make b'lieve, after makin' full\n",
      "allowance for ev'rythin' else, that nobody can bring out the best\n",
      "that's in him until he begins to work for himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No other person would dare criticise your old self in my presence,\n",
      "Caleb,\" said Philip, \"but you've certainly acquired a new manner in\n",
      "business, and it's extremely fetching in more senses than one. One of\n",
      "the best things about it is that the natives notice it, and talk of\n",
      "it to one another, and are pleased by it, for you're one of them, you\n",
      "know. I'm a mere outsider.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do they really notice it?\" asked Caleb, with a suggestion of the\n",
      "old-time pathos in his face and voice, \"an' are they really pleased?\n",
      "Because, as you say, I'm really one of 'em, an' I'm proud of it. I've\n",
      "gone through pretty much ev'rythin' they have--'specially the malaria,\n",
      "an' now that their good times are comin', I'm glad I'm with 'em. But\n",
      "to think--\" here he walked deliberately to a mirror and studied his\n",
      "own face for a moment--\"to think that only so little time ago as when\n",
      "you came here I felt like an old, used-up man, an' I'd put my house in\n",
      "order, so to speak, against the time when I should have my last tussle\n",
      "with malaria, an' go under, with the hope o' goin' upward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was before you met Mary,\" Grace suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; that's so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And he must get rid of Mary before he can ever have an opportunity to\n",
      "feel that way again,\" said the lady referred to, as she looked proudly\n",
      "at her husband. \"Old! Used up! The most spirited, active, hopeful,\n",
      "cheerful man I ever met! But, really, you were different, Caleb, when\n",
      "I first saw you; it doesn't seem possible that you're the same man.\n",
      "From what I've seen of the people here, I believe it is one of the\n",
      "ways of the West for men to try to look older than they are; you must\n",
      "use your influence--and example--to make them stop it. In New York a\n",
      "man seldom looks old until he is very near the grave; the most active\n",
      "and fine-looking business men are beyond threescore, as a rule--about\n",
      "twenty years older than you, Caleb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye--es, but they weren't brought up on malaria, pork, plough-handles,\n",
      "an' saleratus biscuit,\" said Caleb. \"There's hope for a change here,\n",
      "though. Doc Taggess says there's nothin' like as much malaria in town\n",
      "as there was before the swamps were drained, and the good times comin',\n",
      "because o' the railroad, 'll make some more changes for the better,\n",
      "for all of us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few moments each member of the quartet seemed to have dropped\n",
      "into revery. The silence was broken by Philip, who said:--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Caleb, a year ago even you would not have dared to prophesy the\n",
      "changes that have been made, and those which are within sight, yet to\n",
      "you belongs the credit for all of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To me? Well, I've heard and seen so many amazin' calculations in the\n",
      "past three months that I'm prepared to stand up under almost anythin',\n",
      "but I'd like to know how you figure it out that I've done anythin' in\n",
      "particular.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis easily told. If you hadn't fallen in love with Miss Truett,\n",
      "and she with you, her brother wouldn't have come out here, and the\n",
      "malaria wouldn't have been drained from the swamps, and the railway\n",
      "wouldn't have been projected, and the farmers wouldn't have become\n",
      "owners of guaranteed stocks, which has put new life into many of them,\n",
      "and there'd have been no inducement for manufacturers to use our\n",
      "water-power and our hard woods, and no bank would have been possible,\n",
      "nor any of the public improvements,--paving, water service, and others\n",
      "that will soon be under way. Don't you see?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ye--es, as far as you've gone, but I wouldn't have known there was\n",
      "such a person as Mary--bless her!--if you hadn't sent me East, an'\n",
      "your wife--bless her too--hadn't given me a letter of introduction to\n",
      "Mary, so I don't see but that honors are about even. You might as well\n",
      "go back a little further, though, and say that you wouldn't have been\n",
      "here to send me East if your Uncle Jethro hadn't loved your father,\n",
      "an' made up his mind that your father's son shouldn't fool away his\n",

      "I hadn't ought to have let it out; mebbe, on the other hand, it may\n",
      "make you feel kindlier to your Uncle Jethro. But, to go on backward,\n",
      "there wouldn't have been any Jethro to lay up a business start for you\n",
      "if the Somerton family hadn't begun somewhere back in the history of\n",
      "the world, an' when you get that far back you might as well go farther\n",

      "a hurry to get out of it, there wouldn't have been any of us to do\n",
      "anythin'. I tell you, Philip, an' just you keep it in mind against\n",
      "anythin' that may turn up anywhere or at any time, that when there's\n",
      "any glory or credit to be given out, an' you want to do the square\n",

      "Farmers do not like trespassers. If a farmer sees one, he will sometimes shoot at them with a shotgun that he owns. Trespassing is against the law. Laws are created by government to prevent people from living in fear. They are meant to provide safety for citizens. Our government in America consists of a legislative branch, an executive branch, and a judicial branch. The legislative branch makes laws based on the concerns of citizens they represent. The executive branch consists of the President. This person enforces the law, and he has certain other duties like declaring war and approving bills prepared by members of the legislative branch. The President is also considered the leader of our country. The judicial branch interprets the laws. This branch consists of the courts and the trials held in them. Here a judge and jury determine from evidence presented by lawyers whether someone is guilty of breaking a law. Initial law enforcement takes place among police officers. They are the first people to encounter situations where a law is being broken. If a criminal (law-breaker) becomes too violent or hostile, they will use guns or mace or nightsticks to administer immediate punishment. Their goal is to bring the criminal under control, so that he can receive a punishment determined by members of the judicial branch of government. Punishments mostly include time in jail, but they can also include fines and, in extreme cases, the death penalty. There is controversy surrounding the death penalty.\n",

      "Children play with toys. This is common to almost all kids. Toys come in a very wide variety. Boys tend to like cars, action figures, and toy weapons. Girls tend to like dolls, toy kitchens, and make-up. Both of them like building or assembling things, be it with Legos, blocks, Play-Doh, or something similar. Toys can be found at most stores, and these days entire stores are dedicated to selling only toys. The most popular of these is Toys ‘R’ Us (with a backwards “R”). Their mascot is Geoffrey the Giraffe. Children love to go to Toys ‘R’ Us and look at the wide variety of toys available. Most children receive the greatest quanitity of toys on their birthdays, or during the holiday season in December. For the majority of children, this holiday is Christmas. For Jewish children, the holiday is Channakuh. Either way, the kid gets presents during this time, and most of these presents are toys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas is a holiday which has gradually become centered around the character “Santa Claus” and his elves and reindeer. Children are told that Santa’s elves build their toys, and Santa delivers them personally to each house in the world by riding in an airborne sleigh hauled by nine reindeer, including Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, who leads the way. Another popular Christmas character is Frosty the Snowman. Frosty is basically any snowman that comes to life. So during Christmas, many children build snowmen, and some of them hope that theirs might come to life. But all of these characters are myths. The true origin of Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Jesus, who founded the religion of Christianity a couple of thousand years ago. Many popular Christmas carols deal with his story, such as “Joy to the World” and “Silent Night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Other holidays include Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Independence Day. Thanksgiving has become a tradition of preparing large quantities of food for a large gathering of people, mainly family and friends. This meal usually features turkey or ham as the main course. Turkey and ham are both kinds of meat (which I mentioned earlier). The meal usually also consists of dressing and a wide assortment of vegetables (which I also mentioned earlier). The origin of Thanksgiving is usually traced to the days of the pilgrims, who were the first settlers in America. They made peace with the native people, the Indians, and together enjoyed a large feast, thanking God for providing them with such an abundance. (Their concepts of God were probably very different.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Halloween is the holiday when people dress in costumes to look like other characters. Most of these are children, who go from door to door in different neighborhoods to request candy from the people living there. They usually say “trick or treat” then receive a treat. Very rarely does the person in the house respond with a trick. Halloween has some sort of demonic origin that I am not quite sure about, but the name derives from “All Hallow’s Eve.” I will not say much about Independence Day, but it is the day Americans celebrate the anniversary of our independence from Britain. Most families purchase fireworks during this holiday and set them off in their lawns (which I mentioned earlier).\n",
      "\n",
      "America gained independence from Britain in the late 1700’s after the Revolutionary War. Britain was hoping to extend its empire across the Atlantic Ocean, but the colonists who settled the territory did not want to be under Britain’s control, with their various taxes and regulations. Both sides were very passionate about their position on the issue, so a war occurred. This war featured a few heroes, including George Washington and Paul Revere. George Washington became America’s first president when we gained independence. I am not sure what happened to Paul Revere. The Declaration of Independence was written before the war by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 and made clear the position of the colonists. It was signed by many important people, including Ben Franklin and John Hancock. Ben Franklin is well-known for many things. One of these is inventing electrical conductors in the form of lightning rods. A famous tale is that he flew a kite with a small piece of metal somewhere on the string during a lightning storm. This was an effective way to test his theory. Another thing Ben Franklin is known for is publishing Poor Richards Almanac. This was like a magazine and contained some of his famous writings and quotations. One famous quote was “Tell me, I forget. Teach me, I remember. Involve me, I learn.” Maybe this had something to do with why he flew that kite.\n",

      "Trees are one of our most important natural resources. They are made of wood, and wood can be made into a variety of products. Some of the more obvious kinds are furniture, houses, and toothpicks. However, wood can also be made into paper. When I first heard this, I was skeptical, but it is true. Paper is a very important product in our society. Writers and artists have greatly benefited from the invention of paper. With only some paper and a pen or pencil, a writer can produce stories and poems that can captivate readers. They can also write down historical facts about their society. Actually, these writings don’t become historical until years later. At the time, the writings could probably be considered news. Artists use paper for their drawings and paintings. They can also use canvas. Drawings and paintings can be very beautiful. They can depict a wide variety of subjects, including flowers, animals, landscapes, and people. They can be realistic or impressionistic. Some paintings also attempt to convey emotions merely by the way the colors are combined and the brushstrokes are applied. This is a modern or contemporary approach to art. Many people think this approach does not require as much talent as the realistic styles.\n",

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.

      "As the Capital Express train dashed into the village of Bruceton one\n",
      "bright afternoon, a brakeman passing through a car was touched on the\n",
      "shoulder by a man, who said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man that left this in the seat in front got out three stations\n",
      "back. You don't s'pose he'll want it again an' send back for it, do\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The brakeman looked at an object which the speaker held up as he spoke:\n",
      "it was a small fig-box, such as train-boys sometimes succeed in\n",
      "imposing upon the traveling public, and it still contained several\n",
      "figs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Want it again?\" said the brakeman, with a scornful curl of the lip\n",
      "that gave his black moustache a Mephistophelian twist, \"of course not.\n",
      "He left it there so's to get rid of it, like most of 'em do. I wouldn't\n",
      "buy one of them boxes of--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The brakeman suddenly ceased talking, and put both hands on the\n",
      "passenger's shoulders with the movement peculiar to train-men whose\n",
      "duty it is to rouse sleeping passengers, the effect always being to\n",
      "make the victim throw his head slightly backward. Then the brakeman\n",
      "looked a moment into the face before him,--it was small, weak-eyed, and\n",
      "characterless,--and continued,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Sam Kimper, I didn't know you from Adam! That broad-brimmed low\n",
      "hat makes you look like somebody else. When did you get out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This mornin',\" said the passenger, dropping his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did, eh? Well, you needn't feel so bad about it, old man. Anybody's\n",
      "likely to get in trouble once in a while, you know. You got catched;\n",
      "some other folks 'most always don't; that's about the difference. Let's\n",
      "see; how long was you--how long have you been away?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was _sent_ for two years an' a half,\" said the passenger, raising\n",
      "his head again and looking almost manly, \"but, Mr. Briggs, I got all\n",
      "the shortenin' of time that's allowed for good conduct,--ev'ry day of\n",
      "it. If you don't believe it, I'll prove it to you. My term begun on the\n",
      "11th of August, eighteen hundred an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind the figures, old man: I'll take your word for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I wanted you to be sure; I thought mebbe you'd tell other folks\n",
      "about it, seein' you're a good-hearted feller, an' know ev'rybody, an'\n",
      "I never done you no harm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell 'em anyway,\" said the brakeman, cheerily; \"I ain't no saint,\n",
      "but I'm always ready to help a fellow up when he's down. I've got to\n",
      "get to the rear now, to uncouple a car we have to leave here. S'long,\n",
      "Sam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, Mr. Briggs,\" said the passenger, hurrying along behind the\n",
      "brakeman, \"you don't s'pose there's any chance for me to get a job in\n",
      "the railroad-company's yard, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The brakeman turned with a sharp look which speedily softened as he saw\n",
      "an earnest appeal in the little man's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Sam,\" he replied, his words dragging slowly along, \"the yard's\n",
      "always full, an' men a-waitin'. You'd have to give bonds for good\n",
      "behavior, an' honesty, an'--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind the rest, Mr. Briggs,\" said the ex-convict, shrinking an\n",
      "inch or two in stature. \"I didn't know about that, indeed I didn't, or\n",
      "I--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you needn't be a-Mr.-Briggs-in' me, anyhow,\" said the brakeman.\n",
      "\"I was only Jim before--you left town, Sam, an' I want you to go on\n",
      "callin' me Jim, just the same. Do you understand that, confound you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mr.--Jim, I do; an' may God bless you for sayin' it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here we are; good luck by the car-load to you, Sam.\" Then the brakeman\n",

      "\"Bruceton.\"\n",

      "The discharged prisoner consumed a great deal of time and distributed\n",
      "many furtive glances as he alighted, though he got off the train on the\n",
      "side opposite the little station. The train remained so long that when\n",
      "finally it started there was no one on the station platform but the\n",
      "agent, whose face was not familiar to the last passenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gust of wind brought to the platform a scrap of a circus-poster which\n",
      "had been loosened by recent rain from a fence opposite the station. The\n",
      "agent kicked the paper from the platform; Sam picked it up and looked\n",
      "at it; it bore a picture of a gorgeously-colored monkey and the head\n",
      "and shoulders of an elephant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ain't you goin' to put it back?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much,\" said the agent. \"I don't rent that fence to the circus, or\n",
      "menagerie, or whatever it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I have it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Findings are keepings,\" said the agent, \"especially when they ain't\n",
      "worth looking for; that's railroad rule, and I guess circus-companies\n",
      "haven't got a better one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The finder sat down on the platform, took a knife from his pocket, and\n",
      "carefully cut the monkey and the elephant's head from the paper. Then\n",
      "he walked to the end of the platform and looked cautiously in the\n",
      "direction of the town. A broad road, crossed by a narrow street, led\n",
      "from the station; into the street the little man hurried, believing\n",
      "himself secure from observation, but just then the door of a coal-yard\n",
      "office opened, and Judge Prency, who had been county judge, and Deacon\n",
      "Quickset emerged. Both saw the new arrival, who tried to pass them\n",
      "without being recognized. But the deacon was too quick for him;\n",
      "planting himself in the middle of the sidewalk, which was as narrow as\n",
      "the deacon was broad, he stopped the wayfarer and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Samuel, I hope you're not going back to your old ways\n",
      "again,--fighting, drinking, loafing, and stealing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, deacon, I ain't. I'm a changed man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what they all say, Samuel,\" the deacon replied, not unkindly,\n",
      "\"but saying isn't doing. Human nature's pretty weak when it don't lean\n",
      "on a stronger one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's how I'm leanin', deacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm glad to hear it, Samuel,\" said the deacon, offering his hand,\n",
      "though in a rather conservative manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam,\" said the judge, \"I sentenced you, but I don't want you to think\n",
      "hard of me and take it out of my orchard and chicken-coop. It wasn't\n",
      "your first offence, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor the tenth, judge. You did just right. I hope 'twas a warnin' to\n",
      "others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it was,\" said the judge, thrusting both hands into his pockets\n",
      "and studying the wall of the station as if it were the record of his\n",
      "own court. \"I think it was; and here's my hand, Sam, and my best wishes\n",
      "for a square start in life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the judge withdrew his hand he left behind a little wad of paper\n",
      "which Sam recognized by sense of touch as the customary American\n",
      "substitute for the coin of the realm. The poor fellow did not know what\n",
      "to say: so he said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hurry along to your family, Sam. I hope you'll find them all well.\n",
      "I've told my wife to see to it that they didn't suffer while you were\n",
      "away, and I guess she's done it: she's that kind of woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam hurried away. The deacon followed him with his eyes, and finally\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Kimper hurried through a new street, sparsely settled, crossed a\n",
      "large vacant lot, tramped over the grounds of an unused foundry, and\n",
      "finally went through a vacancy in a fence on which there were only\n",
      "enough boards to show what the original plan had been. A heap of ashes,\n",
      "a dilapidated chicken-coop, and a forest of tall dingy weeds were the\n",
      "principal contents of the garden, which had for background a small\n",
      "unpainted house in which were several windows which had been repaired\n",
      "with old hats and masses of newspaper. As he neared the house he saw in\n",
      "a cove in the weeds a barrel lying on its side, and seated in the mouth\n",
      "of the barrel was a child with a thin, sallow, dirty, precocious face\n",
      "and with a cat in her arms. The child stared at the intruder, who\n",
      "stopped and pushed his hat to the back of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pop!\" exclaimed the child, suddenly, without moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary!\" exclaimed the man, dropping upon his knees and kissing the\n",
      "dirty face again and again. \"What are you doin' here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Playin' house,\" said the child, as impassively as if to have had her\n",
      "father absent two years was so common an experience that his return did\n",
      "not call for any manifestation of surprise or affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand up a minute, dear, and let me look at you. Let's see,--you're\n",
      "twelve years old now, ain't you? You don't seem to have growed a bit.\n",
      "How's the rest?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mam's crosser an' crosser,\" said the child; \"Joe's run away, 'cause\n",
      "the constable was after him for stealin' meat from--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My boy a thief! Oh, Lord!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we didn't have nothin' to eat; he had to do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The father dropped his head and shuddered. The child continued:\n",
      "\"Billy's goin' to school now; Jane's servant-gal at the hotel; Tom\n",
      "plays hookey all the time, an' the baby squalls so much that nobody\n",
      "likes her but Billy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The man looked sad, then thoughtful; finally he put his arm around his\n",
      "child, and said, as he kissed and caressed her,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're to have a better dad after this, darlin'; then maybe the\n",
      "mother'll feel pleasanter, an' the baby'll be happier, an' Tom'll be a\n",
      "good boy, an' we'll get Joe back somehow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How's you goin' to be better?\" asked the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goin' to give us money to buy candy an' go to all the circuses?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe,\" said the father. \"I must go see the mother now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The child followed her father to the house; there was not much\n",
      "excitement in the life of the Kimper family, except when there was a\n",
      "quarrel, and Mary seemed to anticipate some now, for she drawled, as\n",
      "she walked along,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mam's got it in for you; I heerd her say so many a time sence you war\n",
      "took away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The poor thing's had reason enough to say it, the Lord knows,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "As Sam entered his house, a shabbily dressed, unkempt, forlorn looking\n",
      "woman sat at a bare pine table, handling some dirty cards. When she\n",
      "looked up, startled by the heavy tread upon the floor, she exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare! I didn't expect you till--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wife!\" shouted Sam, snatching the woman into his arms and covering her\n",
      "face with kisses. \"Wife,\" he murmured, bursting into tears and pressing\n",
      "the unsightly head to his breast,--\"wife, wife, wife, I'm goin' to make\n",
      "you proud of bein' my wife, now that I'm a man once more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman did not return any of the caresses that had been showered\n",
      "upon her; neither did she repel them. Finally she said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You _do_ appear to think somethin' of me, Sam.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Think somethin' of you? I always did, Nan, though I didn't show it\n",
      "like I ought. I've had lots of time to think since then, though, an'\n",
      "I've had somethin' else, too, that I want to tell you about. Things is\n",
      "goin' to be different, the Lord willin', Nan, dear--wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Kimper was human; she was a woman, and she finally rose to the\n",
      "occasion to the extent of kissing her husband, though immediately\n",
      "afterward she said, apparently by way of apology,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know how I come to do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Neither do I, Nan; I don't know how you can do anythin' but hate me.\n",
      "But you ain't goin' to have no new reason for doin' it. I'm goin' to be\n",
      "different ev'ry way from what I was.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope so,\" said Mrs. Kimper, releasing herself from her husband's\n",
      "arms and taking up the cards again. \"I was just tellin' my fortune by\n",
      "the keerds, havin' nothin' else to do, an' they showed a new man an'\n",
      "some money,--though not much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They showed right both times, though keerds ain't been friends to this\n",
      "family, confound 'em, when I've fooled with 'em at the saloon. Where's\n",
      "the baby, though, that I ain't ever seen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the woman, pointing to a corner of the room. Sam looked,\n",
      "and saw on the floor a bundle of dingy clothes from one end of which\n",
      "protruded a head of which the face, eyes, and hair were of the same\n",
      "tint as the clothing. The little object was regarding the new arrival\n",
      "in a listless way, and she howled and averted her head as her father\n",
      "stooped to pick her up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's afraid you're goin' to hit her, like most ev'ry one does when\n",
      "they go nigh her,\" said the mother. \"If I'd knowed you was comin'\n",
      "to-day, I'd have washed her, I guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do it myself now,\" said the father, \"I've got the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you ain't ever done such a thing in your life, Sam!\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Kimper, with a feeble giggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More's the shame to me; but it's never too late to mend. When'll Billy\n",
      "get home, an' Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness knows; Billy gets kep' in so much, an' Tom plays hookey so\n",
      "often, that I don't ever expect either of 'em much 'fore supper-time.\n",
      "They talk of sendin' Tom to the Reform School if he don't stop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll have to stop him, then. I'll try it, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It needs somebody that can wollup him harder'n I can; he's gettin' too\n",
      "big for my stren'th. Well, if here they don't both come! I don't know\n",
      "when I've seen them two boys together before, 'less they was fightin'.\n",
      "I wonder what's got into 'em to-day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two boys came through the back yard, eying the house curiously,\n",
      "Billy with wide open eyes, and Tom with a hang-dog leer from under the\n",
      "brim of his hat. Their father met them at the door and put his arms\n",
      "around both.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't do that,\" said Tom, twitching away, \"that sort o' thing's for\n",
      "women, an' gals an' babies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'm your dad, boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Needn't make a baby of me, if you be,\" growled the cub.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd give a good deal, old as I am, if I had a dad to make a baby of me\n",
      "that way, if 'twas only for a minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't be an old fool,\" said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I heerd in the village you'd been let out,\" said Billy, \"an' so I\n",
      "found Tom an' told him, an' he said I lied, an' so we come home to see.\n",
      "Did you bring us anythin'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the father, his face brightening, as he thrust his hand\n",
      "into his pocket and took out the fig box. \"Here,\" as he gave a fig to\n",
      "each of the children and one to his wife, \"how do you like that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good enough,\" growled Tom, \"only I don't care for 'em unless I have a\n",
      "whole box. I lift one out of a train-boy's basket at the station once\n",
      "in a while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't ever do it again,\" said the father. \"If you want 'em any time so\n",
      "bad you can't do without 'em, let me know, an' I'll find some way to\n",
      "get 'em for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An' get sent up again for more'n two year?\" sneered the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mean to get 'em that way\" said the father. \"But I've got\n",
      "somethin' else for you.\" Here he took the circus pictures from his\n",
      "breast, where they had been much flattened during the several\n",
      "demonstrations of family affection in which they had been involved.\n",
      "\"Here's a picture for each of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy seemed to approve of the monkey, but Tom scowled and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do I care for an elephant's head, when I seen the whole animal at\n",
      "the show, an' everythin' else besides?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"S'pose I might as well get supper, though there ain't much to get,\"\n",
      "said the wife. \"There's nothin' in the house but corn-meal, so I'll\n",
      "bile some mush. An',\" she continued, with a peculiar look at her\n",
      "husband, \"there ain't anythin' else for breakfast, though Deacon\n",
      "Quickset's got lots of hens layin' eggs ev'ry day. I've told the boys\n",
      "about it again an' again, but they're worth less than nothin' at\n",
      "helpin' things along. The deacon don't keep no dog. Now you've got\n",
      "home, I hope we'll have somethin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not if we have to get it that way,\" said Sam, gently. \"No more\n",
      "stealin'; I'll die first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess we'll all die, then,\" moaned Mrs. Kimper. \"I didn't s'pose\n",
      "bein' sent up was goin' to skeer all the spirit out of you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It didn't, Nan, but it's been the puttin' of a new kind of spirit into\n",
      "me. I've been converted, Nan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" gasped Mrs. Kimper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thunder!\" exclaimed Tom, after a hard laugh. \"You goin' to be a\n",
      "shoutin' Methodist? Won't that be bully to tell the fellers in the\n",
      "village?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not goin' to shout, or be anythin' I know of, except an honest\n",

      "\n",
      "\"An' be told I'm a blamed liar? Not much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Kimper seemed to be in a mournful revery, and when finally she\n",
      "spoke it was in the voice of a woman talking to herself, as she said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all I've been layin' up in my mind about places where there was\n",
      "potatoes an' chickens an' pigs an' even turkeys that could be got an'\n",

      "winter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Lord will provide,\" croaked Tom, who had often sat under the\n",
      "church window during a revival meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If He don't, we'll do without,\" said Sam, \"but I guess we won't suffer\n",
      "while I can work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dad converted!\" muttered Tom. \"Dad converted! d'ye hear that?\" said\n",
      "he, hitting his brother to attract attention. \"I must go down to the\n",
      "hotel an' tell Jane; she'll steal me a glass of beer for it. Converted!\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kimper family thinned out, numerically, as soon as the frugal\n",
      "evening meal was despatched. Tom and Billy disappeared separately\n",
      "without remark; Mary put on a small felt hat which added a rakish air\n",
      "to her precocious face, and said she was going to the hotel to see if\n",
      "sister Jane had any news. Half an hour later, the cook, all the\n",
      "chamber-maids, waiters, bar-keepers, and stable-boys at the hostelry\n",
      "were laughing and jeering, in which they were led by Jane, as Mary told\n",
      "of her father's announcement that he had been converted and would have\n",
      "no more stealing done in the interest of the family larder. The fun\n",
      "became so fast and furious that it was obliged to end in sheer\n",
      "exhaustion; so when Tom came in an hour later, he was unable to revive\n",
      "it sufficiently to secure the stolen glass of beer which he had\n",
      "coveted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Kimper did not seem to notice the disappearance of the more active\n",
      "portion of the family. Taking the baby in his arms, he sat with closed\n",
      "eyes while his wife cleared the table. Finally he said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nan, ain't you got nothin' else to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothin', that I know of,\" said the wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come an' set down alongside o' me, then, an' let me tell you about\n",
      "somethin' that come about while I was in the penitentiary. Nan, a man\n",
      "that used to come there Sundays found me a-cryin' in my cell one\n",
      "Sunday; I couldn't help it, I felt so forlorn an' kind o' gone like.\n",
      "I'd felt that way lots o' times before, when I was out an' around, but\n",
      "then I could get over it by takin' a drink. There's always ways of\n",
      "gettin' a drink,--sweepin' out a saloon, or cuttin' wood agin' winter,\n",
      "when the saloon'll need it. But there wasn't no chance to get a drink\n",
      "in jail, an' I was feelin' as if the under-pinnin' of me was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the man said he knowed a friend that would stand by me an' cheer\n",
      "me up. His name was Jesus. I told him I'd heerd of Him before, 'cause\n",
      "I'd been to revival meetin's an' been preached to lots by one man an'\n",
      "another. He said that wasn't exactly the way he wanted me to think\n",
      "about Him,--said Jesus used to be alive and go around bein' sorry for\n",
      "folks that was in trouble, an' He once comforted a thief that was bein'\n",
      "killed in a most uncomfortable way, though Jesus was havin' a hard time\n",
      "of it Himself about that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That hit me where I lived, for I--well, you know what I was sent up\n",
      "for. He said Jesus was God, but he came here to show men how to live,\n",
      "an' he wanted me to think about Him only as a man, while I was in\n",
      "trouble. He said the worse off a man was, the more sorry Jesus was for\n",
      "him: so I said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'I wish He was here now, then.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'He _is_ here, my friend,' said the man. 'He's here, though you can't\n",
      "see Him. He ain't got nothin' to make out of you: neither have I: so\n",
      "you needn't be afraid to take my word for it. I'll tell you some of the\n",
      "things he said.' Then he read me a lot of things that did make me feel\n",
      "lots better. Why, Nan, that man Jesus was so sorry for men in jail that\n",
      "He went back on some high-toned folks that didn't visit 'em: just think\n",
      "of that!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\"'Of course,' said I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Well,' says he, 'just believe in Jesus like you do in Andrew Jackson,\n",
      "and you'll be all right in the course of time. Believe that what He\n",
      "said was true, an' get your mind full of what He said, an' keep it\n",
      "full, remindin' yourself over an' over again for fear you forget it or\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, that was encouragin', for I didn't want to get in no jails no\n",

      "have no home a good deal of the time, an' not overmuch to eat, an' yet\n",

      "\n",
      "The exclamation was called out by the cause of the sudden darkness,\n",
      "which was no other than Deacon Quickset, who had reached the door-way\n",
      "without being heard. The deacon's proportions were generous; those of\n",
      "the door were not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Samuel,\" said the deacon, \"you said this afternoon that you were a\n",
      "changed man, and that you were leaning on a strength greater than your\n",

      "to stay home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me?\" gasped Mrs. Kimper. \"Me?--in meetin'? Goodness, deacon, it gives\n",
      "me the conniptions to think of it! Besides,\"--here she dragged her\n",

      "decent folks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clothes don't count for anything in the house of the Lord,\" said the\n",

      "\n",
      "The church at which Deacon Quickset worshipped was not large, nor was\n",
      "it ever well filled when prayer and experience were the only\n",
      "attractions. When Sam Kimper entered, however, the place seemed so\n",
      "immense and the throng so great that nothing but the bulk of the\n",
      "deacon, which had been prudently placed in the rear of the new convert,\n",
      "kept him from turning about and escaping into the darkness. Even when\n",
      "placed in a seat the outer end of which was occupied by the deacon, the\n",
      "frightened man cast his eyes appealingly towards his keeper,--for such\n",
      "was the relation he felt the deacon bore towards him. Finally he\n",
      "slipped slowly along the seat and whispered,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deacon, I can't speak; I can't think of a word to say. It's a shame to\n",
      "have a fellow like me talkin' to good church-members about what they\n",
      "know more about than him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have to acknowledge Him before men, Samuel, if you expect Him\n",
      "to acknowledge you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I hain't any objections to ownin' up to ev'rybody I know. Didn't\n",
      "I tell you an' the judge? Didn't I tell Nan and the children? I ain't\n",
      "seen anybody else yet, or I'd told them too. But I can't say nothin' to\n",
      "a crowd like this; I don't know how.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He'll give you words, Samuel, if you've got the right heart in you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is that a dead-sure thing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Further argument and protest were ended by the formal opening of the\n",
      "meeting. It appeared to the deacon that the first hymn was sung with\n",
      "more sound and spirit than usual, and on looking around he saw the\n",
      "cause: it was literally a \"packed house,\"--the first one the church had\n",
      "ever known on a prayer-meeting night. The deacon immediately let his\n",
      "own voice out a little more, for he felt personally complimented by the\n",
      "large attendance. He had told a number of persons of Sam's conversion\n",
      "and of his own intention to have the man \"put himself on record\" before\n",
      "a number of witnesses; evidently this word had gone about and caused\n",
      "the great gathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prayers, hymns, and short speeches and confessions succeeded one\n",
      "another for a little while, and the deacon, glancing aside frequently,\n",
      "saw his charge look more and more uncomfortable, helpless, and\n",
      "insignificant as the exercises continued. This would not do; should\n",
      "the fellow become thoroughly frightened, he might not be able to say\n",
      "anything; this would be disappointing to the assemblage, and somewhat\n",
      "humiliating to him who had announced the special attraction of the\n",
      "evening. Sam's opportunity must come at once; he, the deacon, did not\n",
      "doubt that his own long experience in introducing people to the public\n",
      "in his capacity of chairman of the local lecture committee would enable\n",
      "him to present Sam in a manner which would strengthen the weak knees\n",
      "and lift up the feeble heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brethren,\" said the deacon, arising during the closing cadence of a\n",
      "hymn, \"the consolations of our blessed religion often reach a man in\n",
      "most unexpected ways, and we have among us to-night a living example of\n",
      "it. One of our fellow-citizens who left us, against his will, I may\n",
      "say, about two years ago, found the pearl of great price in the cell of\n",
      "a prison. He has come here to-night to testify to the hope that is\n",
      "within him. He feels that he is weak and halting of speech, but,\n",
      "blessed be the spirit of our Master, that makes all of us brothers, it\n",
      "does not take eloquence or superfluity of words to let out anything\n",
      "that the heart is full of. I ask the attention and sympathy of all\n",
      "present for our brother Samuel Kimper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the deacon sat down he put his powerful arm under the shoulder of\n",
      "his companion, and Sam Kimper found himself upon his feet. The\n",
      "frightened man looked down at the cushion of the seat in front of him;\n",
      "then he tried to look around, but there was so much hard curiosity in\n",
      "each face upon which his eyes fell that he speedily looked down again\n",
      "and leaned heavily upon the back of the bench upon which his hands\n",
      "rested. Finally he cleared his throat and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ladies an' gentlemen, I've been in State prison nearly two years. I\n",
      "deserved it. Lots of folks talked kind to me before I went; some of\n",
      "'em's here to-night, an' I thank 'em for what they done. A good many of\n",
      "'em talked religion to me, but the more they talked the less I\n",
      "understood 'em. I guess 'twas my fault; I never had much head-piece,\n",
      "while some of them had. But when I was in the prison a man come along\n",
      "that talked to me about Jesus like I never was talked to before.\n",
      "Somehow I could understand what he was drivin' at. He made me feel that\n",
      "I had a friend that I could foller, even if I didn't keep up with him\n",
      "all the time, owin' to things in the road that I hadn't knowed about.\n",
      "He told me if I'd b'lieve in Jesus as I b'lieved in Andrew Jackson, I'd\n",
      "pull through in the course of time. I've been tryin' to do it, an'\n",
      "while I was in the jail I got lots of new idees of how I ort to behave\n",
      "myself, all from a little book that man left me, that didn't have\n",
      "nothin' in it but Jesus' own words. I'm a-goin' to keep on at it, an'\n",
      "if I can't live that way I'm goin' to die a-tryin'. I b'lieve that's\n",
      "all I've got to say, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an awkward silence for a moment after Sam sat down. The\n",
      "minister in charge of the meeting said afterwards that the remarks were\n",
      "not exactly what he had expected, and he did not know, at such short\n",
      "notice, how to answer them. Suddenly a hymn was started by a voice\n",
      "which every one knew, though they seldom heard it in prayer-meeting. It\n",
      "belonged to Judge Prency's wife, who for years had been the mainstay of\n",
      "every musical entertainment which had been dependent upon local talent.\n",
      "The hymn began,--\n",
      "\n",
      "     Am I a soldier of the cross,\n",
      "\n",
      "and the assemblage sang it with great force and spirit. The meeting was\n",
      "closed soon afterwards; and as Sam, in spite of an occasional kind\n",
      "greeting, was endeavoring to escape from the hard stare of curious\n",
      "eyes, Mrs. Judge Prency, who was the handsomest and most distinguished\n",
      "woman in the village, stopped him, grasped his hand, and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Kimper, you gave the most sensible speech I ever heard in an\n",
      "experience meeting. I'm going to believe in you thoroughly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Deacon Quickset, who was closely following his new charge, listened\n",
      "with fixed countenance to the lady's remark. He followed Sam from the\n",
      "church, snatched him away from the wife who had joined him, and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Samuel, that experience of yours rather disappointed me. It wasn't all\n",
      "there. There was something left out,--a good deal left out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess not, deacon. I said all I knowed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you ought to know a good deal more. You've only got at the\n",
      "beginning of things. No church'll take you into membership if you don't\n",
      "believe more than that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe I'll know it in the course of time, deacon, if I keep on\n",
      "a-learnin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe you will,--if you do keep on. But you didn't say anything about\n",
      "your hope of salvation, nor the atonement, nor your being nothing\n",
      "through your own strength.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't say it if I didn't know about it,\" Sam replied. \"All my\n",
      "troubles an' wrong doin's have come of not livin' right: so right\n",
      "livin' is all I've had time to think about an' study up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You need to think about dying as well as living,\" said the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him that took care of another thief that was dyin' 'll take care of me\n",
      "if I get in that fix, I guess, if I hang on to Him tight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not unless you hang on in the right way,\" said the deacon. \"You must\n",
      "believe what all Christians believe, if you want to be saved. You don't\n",
      "feel that you're prepared to die, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I felt it a good many times, deacon, when I was in that jail; an'\n",
      "sometimes I half wished I could die right away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pshaw!\" muttered the deacon. \"You don't understand. You're groping in\n",
      "darkness. You don't understand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so, deacon, if you mean I don't understand what you're drivin'\n",
      "at.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you feel Christ in you the hope of glory?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what you mean, deacon?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you feel that a sacrifice has been made to atone for your sins?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't follow you, deacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought not. You haven't got things right at all. You haven't been\n",
      "converted: that's what's the matter with you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean, Deacon,\" said Sam, after a moment, \"that what I'm\n",
      "believin' about Jesus is all wrong an' there ain't nothin' in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, no; I can't say that,\" the deacon replied, \"but--but you've\n",
      "begun wrong end first. What a sinner needs most of all is to know about\n",
      "his hereafter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's what's goin' on now, from day to day, that weighs hardest on me,\n",
      "deacon. There's nothin' hard about dyin'; leastways, you'd think so if\n",
      "you was built like me, an' felt like I have to feel sometimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're all wrong,\" said the deacon. \"If you can't understand these\n",
      "things for yourself, you ought to take the word of wiser men for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"S'posin' I was to do that about everythin': then when Judge Prency,\n",
      "who's a square man an' a good deal smarter than I be, talks politics to\n",
      "me, I ought to be a Republican instead of a Jackson Democrat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the deacon, sharply, for he was a Jackson Democrat himself.\n",
      "\"I'll have to talk more to you about this, Samuel. Good night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, deacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He knows more'n you do about religion,\" said Mrs. Kimper, who had\n",
      "followed closely behind, and who rejoined her husband as soon as the\n",
      "deacon departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He ought to, seein' his head-piece an' chances; an' yet I've heerd\n",
      "some pooty hard things said about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the couple reached home, Sam looked at the long heap of straw and\n",
      "rags on which his children should have been sleeping, but which was\n",
      "without occupant except the baby. Then, by the light of the coals still\n",
      "remaining in the fire-place, he looked through some leaves of the\n",
      "little book which the prison visitor had given him. When he arose from\n",
      "the floor, he said to himself,--\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Kimper spent several days in looking about his native town for\n",
      "work. He found many sympathetic assurances, some promises, and no work\n",
      "at all. Everybody explained to everybody else that they were sorry for\n",
      "the poor wretch, but they couldn't afford to have a jail-bird around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Sam's stock of money, accumulated by overwork in the State\n",
      "prison, and augmented by Judge Prency's present, was running low. He\n",
      "kept his family expenses as low as possible, buying only the plainest\n",
      "of food-material and hesitating long to break a bill, though it were\n",
      "only of the denomination of one dollar. Nevertheless the little wad of\n",
      "paper money in his pocket grew noticeably thinner to his touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "His efforts to save the little he had in his possession were not\n",
      "assisted by his family. His wife, thanks and perhaps blame to the\n",
      "wifely sense of dependence upon her husband, had fallen back upon him\n",
      "entirely after what he had said about his intention as to the future of\n",
      "the family, and she not only accepted his assurances as bearing upon\n",
      "the material requirements of several mouths from day to day, but she\n",
      "also built some air-castles which he was under the unpleasant necessity\n",
      "of knocking down. The poor woman was not to blame. She never had seen a\n",
      "ten-dollar bill since the day of her marriage, when, in a spasm of\n",
      "drunken enthusiasm, her husband gave a ten-dollar Treasury note to the\n",
      "clergyman who officiated on that joyous occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening Sam took his small change from his pocket to give his son\n",
      "Tom money enough to buy a half-bushel of corn-meal in the village. As\n",
      "he held a few pieces of silver in one hand, touching them rapidly with\n",
      "the forefinger of the other, his son Tom exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're just overloaded with money, old man! Say, gi' me a quarter to\n",
      "go to the ball game with? I'm in trainin', kind o' like, an' I ain't\n",
      "afeard to say that mebbe I'll turn out a first-class pitcher one of\n",
      "these days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tom,\" said his father, trying to straighten his feeble frame, as his\n",
      "eyes brightened a little, \"I wish I could: I'd like you to go into\n",
      "anything that makes muscle. But I can't afford it. You know I'm not\n",
      "workin' yet, an' until I do work the only hope of this family is in the\n",
      "little bit of money I've got in my pocket.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Tom, thrusting out his lower lip, slouching across the\n",
      "room, and returning again, \"I don't think a quarter's enough to trouble\n",
      "anybody's mind about what'll happen to his family afterwards. I've\n",
      "heard a good deal from the mother about you bein' converted, and\n",
      "changin' into a different sort of a man, but I don't think much of any\n",
      "kind of converted dad that don't care enough for his boy to give him a\n",
      "quarter to go to a ball game.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Food before fun, Tom,\" said the father, resolutely closing his hand\n",
      "upon such remaining silver as he had, and then thrusting the fistful\n",
      "into his pocket,--\"food before fun. Ball isn't business to this family\n",
      "just now, an' money means business ev'ry time. When I was away an'\n",
      "couldn't help it, things mebbe didn't go as they ort to have gone, but\n",
      "now that I'm back again, there shan't be any trouble if I know how to\n",
      "stand in the way of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This expression of principle and opinion did not seem to impress\n",
      "favorably the eldest male member of the second generation. Master Tom\n",
      "thrust out his lower lip again, glared at his father, took his hat, and\n",
      "abruptly departed. There was no dinner at the Kimper table that day,\n",
      "except for such members of the family as could endure slices of cold\n",
      "boiled pork with very little lean to it. Late in the afternoon,\n",
      "however, Tom returned, with an air of bravado, indulged in a number of\n",
      "reminiscences of the ball game, and at last asked why supper was not\n",
      "ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tom,\" asked the father, \"why didn't you come back to-day with what I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I guess I am somebody now'days. The time you was in jail, I\n",
      "thought the family had a mighty slim chance o' countin'; but I tumbled\n",
      "into base-ball, an' I was pretty strong in my arms an' pretty spry on\n",
      "my feet, an' little by little I kind o' came to give the family a\n",
      "standin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I s'pose that's all right,\" said the father; \"but I want you to\n",
      "understan' one thing, an' understan' it so plain that you can't ever\n",
      "make any mistake about it afterwards. When I put any money into your\n",
      "hands to be used for anythin', it don't matter what, you must spend it\n",
      "for that, or you must get an awful thrashin' when you come back home\n",
      "again. Do you understan' me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The feeding motions of the eldest male of the Kimper collection of\n",
      "children stopped for an instant, and Master Tom leered at his father as\n",

      "had shaken him out of the chair, thrown him upon the floor, and was\n",
      "resting upon him with both knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tom,\" said Sam to his astonished son, \"you was the first boy I ever\n",

      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, he was out and about soon after breakfast, and he\n",
      "wandered through every street of the village in which any business was\n",
      "being done. Again and again he asked for work, and as often the offer\n",
      "was refused or declined or relegated into the uncertain future for a\n",
      "decision. The surplus in his pocket had grown lamentably small. As he\n",
      "made his way homeward in a physical and mental condition which made it\n",
      "impossible for him either to argue to himself or to express a sense of\n",
      "hope to any extent, he passed the shop of Larry Highgetty. Larry was a\n",
      "shoemaker. Sam had worked at shoemaking while he was in State prison.\n",
      "He felt, although Larry might have been offended at the imputation,\n",
      "that there ought to be a fellow-feeling between them; so he ventured\n",
      "into the shop. Larry was sitting at his bench with a lady's shoe in one\n",
      "hand and with his head leaning against the wall of the room. From the\n",
      "stertorous noise which escaped his nostrils, it was quite evident that\n",
      "he was asleep, and an odor which filled the room left the visitor in\n",
      "no doubt as to the nature of the opiate which had induced Larry's\n",
      "mid-day nap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You seem to be takin' business very easy, Mr. Highgetty,\" said Sam,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Better?\" said Larry, rubbing his eyes. \"I don't want it to be any\n",
      "better than it is now. Besides, people's comin' in all the time faster\n",
      "than I can tend to 'em; ev'rybody wants his work done first an' is\n",
      "willin' to pay extra price to get it. Better, is it? Well, yes; I\n",

      "\n",
      "Sam began work upon the bit of repairing which he had taken from the\n",
      "shoemaker's hands, and although it was not of the routine nature which\n",
      "all of his jail-work had placed in his hands, he knew enough of the\n",
      "requirements of an ordinary shoe to do what was necessary. While he was\n",
      "working, the room suddenly darkened, and as he looked up he saw Mrs.\n",
      "Judge Prency herself.\n",

      "looked up only for a second at a time during the next few moments, but\n",
      "what he saw impressed him very favorably. Mrs. Prency was not a young\n",
      "woman, but apparently she had a clear conscience and a good digestion,\n",
      "for she sat with an entirely satisfied and cheerful air, with her\n",
      "shoulders against the back of the chair, as if it were a real pleasure\n",
      "to rest against something, while her cheeks flushed, probably from the\n",
      "exertion of a rapid walk from some other portion of the town. Like any\n",
      "other woman of good health, good character, and good principles, she\n",
      "was a pleasing object to look upon, and the ex-convict looked at her\n",
      "as often as he dared, with undisguised and respectful admiration. But\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sam--Mr. Kimper, I've heard some remarks about your speech at the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You did quite right, Mr. Kimper: you spoke like a real, true, honest\n",

      "the judge, thinks as I do. I told him what you said,--I remembered it\n",
      "all, word for word,--and he said to me,--these are exactly his\n",

      "\n",
      "There was silence for a moment or two. Sam quickened his labors upon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Kimper, don't mistake the meaning of what I am going to ask you. I\n",

      "you and sympathy for you as the best friend you have. But I want to ask\n",
      "you one thing, merely out of curiosity. Has any one questioned you,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, ma'am, if he comes in on me anywhere, an' asks any questions,\n",
      "an' they're on the subject I talked about that night at the church\n",

      "again could get into his last winter's jacket without subjecting\n",
      "himself to a series of remarks by the boys in the town, which would\n",
      "make him feel very uncomfortable. Billy, who had gone barefooted all\n",
      "summer, as was the custom with the boys in town, came home late one\n",
      "evening and announced triumphantly,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dad, you needn't bother yourself about me any more about shoes. I've\n",
      "got a pair. See here!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The head of the family took the new shoes into his hand and examined\n",
      "them. Then he dropped them with a sort of shiver, for they were of a\n",
      "well-remembered pattern,--that upon which he had worked for two years\n",
      "in the penitentiary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you get 'em, Billy?\" the father asked, at length.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I found 'em,\" said the boy, with a wink at his elder brother,--a\n",
      "wink which was returned to him in the shape of an evil leer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Found 'em! Where? Tell me all about it,\" said the father, very sharply\n",
      "and sternly, for he remembered a time when he had \"found\" things\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy looked appealingly at his brother Tom, but the elder brother put\n",
      "on a hang-dog look and sauntered out of the room and was afterwards\n",
      "seen disappearing rapidly through the back yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Billy, at last, with the air of one who was entirely\n",
      "unbosoming himself, \"I'll tell you how it was, dad. Down at Price's\n",
      "store there's a long string of shoes out at the door. They use 'em as a\n",
      "sign, don't you know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the father carelessly; \"I've seen such signs. Go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I need shoes awfully, you know, an' I've been tellin' the mother\n",
      "about it for a week or ten days, an' she said she was tellin' you. But\n",
      "my feet gets awful cold late at nights and early in the mornin's. An' I\n",
      "didn't want to bother you, knowin' that you hadn't any money to spare,\n",
      "'cause the mother told me 'bout that too, an' cried about it. Well, it\n",
      "blowed like ev'rythin' this afternoon as I was goin' towards Price's,\n",
      "an' that string of shoes just whirled around like a kite-tail, an' at\n",
      "last the bottom pair flew off into the street. An' I picked 'em up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Findin's is keepin's,\" said Mrs. Kimper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give me them shoes, my boy,\" said the ex-convict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're goin' to take 'em away from me? Have I got to have cold feet\n",
      "some more?\" said Billy, appealingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam thrust his hand into his trousers-pocket, took out a very thin wad\n",
      "of green paper, looked at it, and finally said, \"No, I s'pose not.\"\n",
      "Nevertheless he and the shoes disappeared from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a short time Mr. Price, the owner of one of the village stores,\n",
      "received a call from the ex-convict, who said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Price, one o' my boys found a pair o' shoes in the street in front\n",
      "o' your store this afternoon durin' the hard blow, an', as they just\n",
      "fitted him, I came around to pay you for them. How much are they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several men were standing about the stove in Price's store, the fire\n",
      "having just started for the autumn and winter season, and, as they\n",
      "heard Sam's remark, one of them uttered a long combination of word and\n",
      "whistle that sounded very much like \"Whew-w?\" Sam turned quickly,\n",
      "recognized the man as one whom he knew to be not over-honest, and\n",
      "said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When _you_ pay for ev'rythin' you get it'll be time to make fun of\n",
      "somebody else. But, Mr. Price, what I asked you was, what's the price\n",
      "o' them shoes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The storekeeper was so astonished at such a question from a member of\n",
      "the Kimper family that, looking at shoes of the same quality which were\n",
      "lying in a box behind the counter, he actually mistook the cost-mark\n",
      "for the selling-price, and replied, \"Only a dollar and a quarter, Mr.\n",
      "Kimper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam laid down the money, received some change, and departed, while the\n",
      "men who were lounging about the store began an active conversation as\n",
      "to whether that man was the fool he looked or whether he was not\n",
      "perhaps a regular sharper whose natural abilities and inclinations had\n",
      "been cultivated during the two years he was in State prison. They\n",
      "understood, those evening loafers, that prisons were nominally for the\n",
      "purpose of reforming criminals, but they had known a great many\n",
      "criminals themselves, and their astonishment at seeing one who\n",
      "apparently desired to do better than in his past life, and to make\n",
      "amends for the misdeeds of his family, was so great that the\n",
      "conversation which ensued after the exit of the ex-convict was very\n",
      "fragmentary and not at all to the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning Sam appeared bright and early at the shoe-shop of\n",
      "Larry Highgetty. He had made an arrangement with the cobbler to do\n",
      "whatever work might be assigned him and to accept as full payment\n",
      "one-half the money which would be charged, most of it being for\n",
      "repairs. As nearly as he could discover by a close questioning of the\n",
      "proprietor of the establishment, the entire receipts did not exceed two\n",
      "dollars per day, and the owner had so few responsibilities and so much\n",
      "surplus that he would be quite glad if he might lounge at one or other\n",
      "of the local places of entertainment while some one else should do the\n",
      "work and keep the establishment open. Consequently Sam went at the work\n",
      "with great energy, and little by little nearly all the work came to be\n",
      "done by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had hammered away for a few minutes on a sole to be placed on the\n",
      "bottom of a well-worn shoe belonging to a workingman, when a new\n",
      "customer entered the shop. Sam looked up at him and saw Reynolds\n",
      "Bartram. He offered a short, spasmodic, disjointed prayer to heaven,\n",
      "for he remembered what the judge's wife had said, and he had known\n",
      "Reynolds Bartram as a young man of keen wit and high standing as a\n",
      "debater before Sam's enforced retirement; now, he knew, Bartram had\n",
      "become a lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Sam,\" said Bartram, as he seated himself in the only chair and\n",
      "proceeded to eye the new cobbler, while the blows of the hammer struck\n",
      "the sole more rapidly and vigorously than before,--\"well, Sam, I\n",
      "understand that you have been turning things upside down, and instead\n",
      "of coming out of the penitentiary a great deal worse man than when you\n",
      "went in, as most other men do, you have been converted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's my understandin' of it, Mr. Bartram,\" said the ex-convict,\n",
      "continuing his inflictions upon the bit of leather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam,\" said Bartram, \"I am a man of business, and I suppose you are\n",
      "from what I see you doing. I wish to make you a proposition: I will pay\n",
      "you cash for two or three hours' time if you will tell me--so that I\n",
      "can understand it--what being converted really amounts to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The new cobbler did not cease an instant his attention to the work in\n",
      "his hand. He merely said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bartram, you're a very smart man, an' I'm a very stupid one. If\n",
      "there's a stupider man in town the Democratic local committee has never\n",
      "yet been able to find him. You want to know what bein' converted means?\n",
      "You'd better go to Deacon Quickset, or the minister of some one of the\n",
      "churches hereabouts. I can't explain anythin', I don't know anythin'\n",
      "but what I feel myself, an' the more I feel it the more I don't know\n",
      "how to talk about it. Deacon Quickset says it don't 'mount to much. I\n",
      "s'pose it don't--to him, he bein' so much smarter than me. But, so far\n",
      "as it goes, I can't be paid for talkin' about it, for it didn't cost me\n",
      "nothin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not what the visitor had expected; nevertheless, it is a\n",
      "lawyer's business to know more than one way of putting a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"See here, Sam; I need a new pair of shoes,--soft leather, thin soles,\n",
      "good cut; do you suppose you know how to measure me for them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I guess I've found out that much, Mr. Bartram.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go ahead, then; don't let me interfere with the measurement; but I\n",
      "want to ask you some questions; tell me what you can as you go along.\n",
      "You've been converted, they say, and you say so too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" said Sam, dropping the tape-line for a moment; \"what other\n",
      "people say I'm not responsible for, but I say it myself that I'm a\n",
      "different man. That's all I can say, Mr. Bartram; an', as I said\n",
      "before, if you want to know more, you'd better ask somebody that's been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense, Sam! you are too modest. As they say in churches, the newest\n",

      "Strong opinions amount to everything in the legal business, and so I\n",
      "have come to you, just as squarely as I could go to any man in the\n",
      "world about anything else that he understood, to ask you plainly what\n",
      "you know about this new life that you are said to be leading now. Tell\n",
      "it to me, out and out. Don't be afraid to keep back anything. Take all\n",
      "the time you like at it. If you can't say just what you want to, try to\n",
      "put it as clearly as you can. I didn't come in to worry you. Remember\n",
      "that I really want some distinct information on the subject.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked up keenly, and said, \"Mr. Bartram, are you in earnest?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam Kimper,\" said the young lawyer, \"if I were not in earnest do you\n",
      "suppose I'd come into this shop during the business hours of the day\n",
      "and ask questions of this kind, when there are plenty of other people I\n",
      "could go to and get the information I want, and perhaps a good deal\n",
      "more? No, sir; I have come here to ask you because I thought that\n",
      "whatever you could say you would say in the fewest possible words and\n",
      "say it right to the point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Mr. Bartram, I'm not used to talkin' to lawyers. I never talked\n",
      "to any but once, you know, an' then I don't think they had very much\n",

      "respect for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This hasn't anything to do with those times, Sam,\" said the lawyer. \"A\n",

      "very straightforward and honestly on this subject a few nights ago.\n",
      "That's more than I have been able to find anybody do in this town in a\n",
      "long time. I don't mind saying to you that, according to what the\n",
      "people who are the most prominent in the church say, I'm a pretty hard\n",
      "character. Therefore whatever you have to say you needn't be afraid to\n",
      "put very plainly. I simply want to know about myself; that's all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bartram,\" said the cobbler, \"as I've already said, you had a good\n",
      "deal better talked to somebody else. But, seem' you've come to me, I've\n",
      "only this to say to you, an' I hope you can make somethin' out of it,\n",
      "because I give you my word I've made more out of it than ever I did out\n",
      "of anythin' else on the face of the earth. I went to jail for stealin'.\n",
      "I hadn't ever been an honest man in my life. The only reason I hadn't\n",
      "been in jail all my life was that I hadn't been caught. At last I was\n",
      "caught, an' I was sent up, an' I don't mind sayin' that I think my\n",
      "sentence was mighty light, considerin' all the heavy mischief that I'd\n",
      "done durin' my life. While I was in jail I was talked to by a man that\n",
      "used to come through there to talk to the prisoners on Sundays. An'\n",
      "about all he said to me was to read me a lot o' things that Jesus\n",
      "Christ said when He was alive in this world, an' told me to go ahead\n",
      "an' do all them things just as well as I knowed how to, an' if I did\n",

      "more than that?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "somethin' I can do besides that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Sam,\" said the lawyer, \"that's an odd question to ask me. I have\n",
      "seen you in church frequently since you were first a young man, ten\n",
      "years older than I. You have been told frequently what else you ought\n",
      "to do; and what I came in particular to ask you was as to how far\n",
      "you've done it, or been able to do it, or were trying to do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You come to the wrong shop, then, Mr. Bartram,\" said the cobbler.\n",
      "\"When a man's been livin' wrong all his life an' has had somethin' put\n",
      "into him to make him feel like turnin' round an' livin' right, the\n",

      "Little by little the Kimper family was made more comfortable and put in\n",
      "better condition for the coming winter. Broken window-panes were\n",
      "mended, though frequently only with bits of board closely wedged,\n",
      "cracks in the wall were stuffed with dried grass and plastered with\n",
      "mud, and clean straw replaced the dirty substitutes for beds and\n",
      "mattresses. The head of the family worked hard at the cobbler's shop,\n",
      "yet did not cease working when he reached home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet week by week Sam looked better than in old times. Conrad Weitz, the\n",

      "were incessantly arguing over the liquor question, and never lost an\n",
      "opportunity of bringing up a new point about it when they met by any\n",
      "chance. Weitz was a public-spirited and intelligent citizen, and the\n",
      "deacon believed that if his opinions about the moral nature of his\n",
      "business could be changed there would be a great gain for the\n",
      "temperance cause in Bruceton. Besides, Weitz was a well-to-do man and\n",
      "saved a great deal of money, some of which the deacon had invested for\n",
      "him, and all of which the deacon desired to handle, for he was a man of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You're all wrong about that, Weitz,\" said the deacon, sitting upon an\n",

      "probably in the way the same meanings are translated to babies\n",
      "everywhere else, and from being a forlorn and fretful child it\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleanor Prency was the handsomest girl in all Bruceton. Indeed, she so\n",
      "far distanced all other girls in brilliancy and manners, as well as in\n",
      "good looks, that no other young woman thought of being jealous of her.\n",
      "Among her sex she occupied the position of a peerless horse or athlete\n",
      "among sporting men; she was \"barred\" whenever comparisons were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she was an only child, she was especially dear to her parents, who\n",
      "had bestowed upon her every advantage which their means, intelligence,\n",
      "and social standing could supply, and she had availed herself of all of\n",
      "them apparently to the fullest extent. She was not lacking in\n",
      "affection, sense, self-control, and a number of virtues which some\n",
      "girls entirely satisfactory to their parents possessed in less measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless the judge and his wife were deeply anxious about their\n",
      "daughter's future. She was good--as girls go; she attended regularly\n",
      "the church of which the family, including herself, were members; she\n",
      "had no bad habits or bad tastes; her associates were carefully\n",
      "selected; and yet the judge and his wife spent many hours, which should\n",
      "have been devoted to sleep, in endeavoring to forecast her future.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all a matter of heredity. At middle age the judge and his wife\n",
      "were fully deserving of the high esteem in which they were held by the\n",
      "entire community. They were an honest, honorable, Christian couple,\n",
      "living fully up to the professions they made. In their youthful days\n",
      "they had been different--in some respects. Well off, handsome, and\n",
      "brilliant, they had both been among the most persistent and successful\n",
      "of pleasure-seekers. Reviewing those days, Mrs. Prency could say that\n",
      "utter selfishness and self-love had been her deepest sins. Her husband,\n",
      "looking back at his own life, could truthfully say the same, but the\n",
      "details were different. He had looked upon the wine-cup and every other\n",
      "receptacle in which stimulants were ever served. He had tried every\n",
      "game of chance and gone through all other operations collectively known\n",
      "as \"sowing one's wild oats.\" Respect for his wife caused him to break\n",
      "from all his bad habits and associations, at first haltingly and with\n",
      "many relapses, but afterwards by joining the church and conforming his\n",
      "life to his faith. But the inheritance of the child was from her\n",
      "parents, as they were, not as they afterwards became.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the couple became anxious anew when they discovered that\n",
      "their daughter had become very fond of Reynolds Bartram, for the young\n",
      "man forcibly reminded both of them of the judge himself in his early\n",
      "days, yet without Prency's strong and natural basis of character, while\n",
      "the daughter was entirely devoted to the pleasures of the day. If\n",
      "Bartram were to remain as he was, and his self-satisfaction to continue\n",
      "so strong as to be manifest upon all occasions and in all circumstances\n",
      "they foresaw a miserable life for their daughter. Hence Mrs. Prency's\n",
      "solicitude about young Bartram.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day Mrs. Prency made a business excuse to call again on the\n",
      "cobbler's assistant.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am, he came,\" said the cobbler, selecting some buttons from a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did he talk with you on the subject that I supposed he would.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Sam, \"he did; quite a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you change your views at all under his arguments?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, ma'am,\" said the man, looking up with an eager expression of\n",
      "countenance. \"How could I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad,\" murmured the woman. \"Well, what did he say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't repeat all his words, Mrs. Prency, because he talks a good\n",
      "deal better than I do, you know, an' maybe I wouldn't give them the\n",
      "sense that they had,--the way that he meant them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did he seem to take what you said to him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid, ma'am,\" said Sam, \"that what I said didn't entirely suit\n",
      "him; because when I got through all he said was, 'Pshaw!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Prency looked at the shoe through which the needle was rapidly\n",
      "passing back and forth, and finally said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He hasn't come again, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, ma'am, he has,--several times. I never knew any other man to\n",
      "be so much interested in the makin' of one pair of shoes as he has been\n",
      "about them that he ordered of me that day. He says they're not in any\n",
      "hurry, an' yet he comes in every day or two to talk about them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" said Mrs. Prency, her face brightening. \"Doesn't he talk of\n",
      "anything but his shoes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am,\" sighed Sam; \"he comes back to the old subject always;\n",
      "an' it does seem to me as if the one thing he was thinkin' about an'\n",
      "tryin' to do was to break me down in what I've learned to believe. It\n",
      "don't seem, ma'am, to me that it's very big business for a smart feller\n",
      "like him to be in, when he knows what a common sort of a feller I am,\n",
      "an' what little I've got, an' how much I need all that I've got, if I'm\n",
      "goin' to keep straight any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Kimper,\" said the lady, \"try not to look at it in that way. He is\n",
      "not trying to break you down; he is trying to satisfy himself. Don't\n",
      "give way, and he dare not. If he did not believe a great deal of what\n",
      "you have been saying to him, he would not keep up his interest in it.\n",
      "Mr. Kimper, it may not seem possible to you, but there is a chance of\n",
      "your doing better work in the missionary cause for that young man than\n",
      "anybody and everybody else in this town has yet been able to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nonsense, Mrs. Prency!\" said the cobbler, dropping the shoe and\n",
      "looking up incredulously. \"He's got a thousand times as much head-piece\n",
      "as I have, an' if he can't learn what he wants to from other people\n",
      "there ain't the slightest likelihood of my ever learnin' him anythin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam,\" said Mrs. Prency, earnestly, \"in the book that you have been\n",
      "reading so industriously, from which you have learned so much, and from\n",
      "which I hope you will continue to learn a great deal, don't you\n",
      "remember something that is said about the Lord having selected the\n",
      "feeble ones of this world to confound the wise?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked down meditatively at the dropped shoe, and replied in a\n",
      "moment,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now you speak of it, ma'am, I think I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You certainly will believe that as much as everything else you have\n",

      "\"Why, of course; I'll have to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then; apply it to yourself, and try to be patient the next\n",
      "time that young man comes to annoy you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam rested his elbows on his knees and dropped the shoe again for a\n",
      "moment, and at last, resuming his work, said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll take your word for it, ma'am: you know a good deal more\n",
      "about such things than I do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradually the cobbler's face began to contract. His needle and thread\n",
      "moved more and more rapidly through the buttons and the leather. At\n",
      "last he laid the shoe aside with an air of desperation, looked up\n",
      "defiantly, and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Prency, I don't mean no offence, an' I ain't the kind of person\n",
      "that meddles with other people's business, an' I hope you won't feel\n",
      "hurt or angry at anythin' that I'm goin' to say to you, because there\n",
      "is somethin' behind it. So I hope you won't think I'm meddlin' with\n",
      "your affairs, if you'll listen to me just a little while. I--I--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well?\" said the lady, for Sam seemed to be hesitating about what he\n",
      "wanted to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't hardly know how to say it, ma'am, an' I'm awfully afraid to\n",
      "say it at all; but--well, there, Mrs. Prency, I guess I know why you\n",
      "are so very much interested in the religious welfare of that young\n",
      "lawyer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge's wife had naturally a very good complexion, but her face\n",
      "flushed deeper as she looked inquiringly at the cobbler but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've seen him,\" said Sam,--\"I can't help seein' things when I'm goin'\n",
      "along in the street, you know, or happen to look out through the\n",
      "windows,--I've seen him in company once in a while with that daughter\n",
      "of yours, Mrs. Prency,--with that young lady that seems to me to be too\n",
      "good to talk to any young man that lives in this town. He is very fond\n",
      "of her, though; nobody can help seein' that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose he is,\" said Mrs. Prency, with an embarrassed manner. \"Young\n",
      "men have very quick perceptions and correct tastes in matters of that\n",
      "kind, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am,\" said the cobbler, \"and they don't differ much from young\n",
      "women. Seems to me your daughter, ma'am, seems to think a good deal of\n",
      "him, too. Well, I don't wonder at it, for he's the finest lookin' young\n",
      "feller anywhere about here; an' if they go to thinkin' more and more of\n",
      "each other as they go on, you would like him to be a good deal better\n",
      "man than he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge's wife dropped her eyes and seemed in doubt for an instant as\n",
      "to whether to be angry or only amused. Finally she looked up frankly\n",
      "and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Kimper, you're a parent and so am I. I see you have been putting\n",
      "yourself in my place. It is quite natural that you should do so, and it\n",
      "is very creditable to you that you have done it in the way you have.\n",
      "You are quite right in your surmise; but may I ask why you have spoken\n",
      "to me about it in this way?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just what I was comin' to, ma'am,\" said the cobbler. \"I've got\n",

      "the same day with that glorious gal of yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Kimper!\" murmured the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well if you don't, I don't see how you can help doin' it; that's all.\n",
      "Your daughter is a lady. She shows in her everythin' that there is in\n",
      "her father and mother, an' everybody knows that they're the finest\n",
      "people hereabouts. My child is the daughter of a thief an' a brawler\n",
      "an' a loafer, an' she's a servant in a common hotel, which is about as\n",
      "low down, I s'pose, as any gal can get in this town that don't go to\n",
      "the bad entirely. Mrs. Prency, that gal has broke my heart. I don't\n",
      "have no influence over her at all. You want me to help you out about\n",
      "your daughter. I am goin' to do it just as far as heaven will give me\n",
      "the strength to do it. Now I want to throw myself right at your feet\n",
      "an' beg you, for the love of God, to try to do somethin' for _my_\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, Mr. Kimper, certainly,\" said the judge's wife. \"I am very glad\n",
      "you spoke to me about her. But, really, I have tried to do a great deal\n",
      "for her. While you were away I used to send clothing to your wife for\n",

      "at school.\"\n",

      "ever believe, I s'pose,--anybody that knows me an' knows her too. But I\n",
      "can't get no light nor no sense about it. But I'm only a man, Mrs.\n",

      "\"I might,\" said the lady, after musing a little while, \"I might\n",

      "would not care for such a position, for I have always discovered that\n",
      "the servants who have been in hotels are dissatisfied with any other\n",

      "\"it's the hardest question that ever come up to me in all my life. It's\n",

      "\n",
      "Reynolds Bartram was greatly annoyed by the results of the several\n",
      "interviews he had imposed upon the new assistant cobbler at Bruceton.\n",
      "He had silenced, if not conquered, all the other religious\n",
      "controversialists of the town, and found the weak spots in the armor of\n",
      "many good people not given to controversy, whom he had beguiled into\n",
      "talking on religious themes. Why he should want to converse at all upon\n",
      "such subjects puzzled the people of the town, all of whom had known him\n",
      "from boyhood as a member of a family so entirely satisfied with itself\n",
      "that it never desired any aid from other people, to say nothing of\n",
      "higher powers. Sometimes the Bartrams went to church for social\n",
      "purposes, but always with an air of conferring a favor upon the power\n",
      "in whose honor the edifice was erected.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bartram had good enough reasons for his sudden interest in\n",
      "religion. He was in love with Eleanor Prency, and, after the manner of\n",
      "his family regarding everything that interested them, he was\n",
      "tremendously in earnest with his wooing. Like a judicious lawyer, he\n",
      "had endeavored to make his way easier by prepossessing the girl's\n",
      "parents in his favor; but when he began to pass the lines of pleasing\n",
      "civility, within which he had long known the judge and his wife, he was\n",
      "surprised to find an undercurrent of seriousness, the existence of\n",
      "which in the Prency family he never had suspected. The judge appeared\n",
      "to estimate everything from the stand-point of religion and\n",
      "righteousness; so did his wife; so, though in less measure, did the\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such nonsense, as the self-sufficient youth regarded it, was annoying.\n",
      "To visit a pleasant family with the intention of making a general\n",
      "conquest and find himself confronted by a line of obstacles which he\n",
      "always had regarded as trifling, yet which he was unable to overcome,\n",
      "and to be told that religion was a reality because it had changed Sam\n",
      "Kimper, one of the most insignificant wretches in town, from a lazy,\n",
      "thievish drunkard to an honest, sober, industrious citizen,--all this\n",
      "was to make war upon Reynolds Bartram's constitutional opinions as to\n",
      "the fitness of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "A change of opinion somewhere was necessary: so it must occur in the\n",
      "Prency family, and as soon as it could be brought about. This was\n",
      "Bartram's first conclusion, after an hour of deep thought. He had\n",
      "started upon a love-making enterprise, and he objected to a\n",
      "complication of interests. If the Prencys chose to talk theology in the\n",
      "privacy of their family life, they were welcome to do so, but he wished\n",
      "none of it, and, unless his head had lost its cunning, he believed he\n",
      "could devise a method of preventing further inflictions of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He convinced himself that his best method would be to discover and\n",
      "expose the weakness, perhaps hypocrisy, of the wretched cobbler's\n",
      "professions. Maybe Kimper meant all he said, and thought he believed\n",
      "something which was essential to religion; but had not scores of other\n",
      "common fellows in the town done likewise, during \"revivals\" and other\n",
      "seasons of special religious effort, only to fall back into their old\n",
      "ways soon afterwards? It was all a matter of birth and training, argued\n",
      "Bartram to himself: the feeblest and most excitable intellects, the\n",
      "world over, were the first to be impressed by whatever seemed\n",
      "supernatural, whether it were called religion, spiritualism, mesmerism,\n",
      "or anything else. It was merely a matter of mental excitement: the\n",
      "stronger the attack, the sooner the relapse. Sam Kimper would lose\n",
      "faith in his fancies sooner or later; it might be somewhat cruel to\n",
      "hasten this result, but what was a little more or less of the life of\n",
      "such a fellow, compared with the lifelong happiness of one of the\n",
      "Bartrams,--the last of the family, and, as the young man fully\n",
      "believed, the best? Should the cobbler's fall be hastened, Bartram\n",
      "would make it right; indeed, he would volunteer in his defense the\n",
      "first time he should again be arrested for fighting or stealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his plan did not work. Day after day he had made excuses to drop\n",
      "into the cobbler's shop and worry the ex-convict into a discussion, but\n",
      "not once did he depart without a sense of defeat. As he said to\n",
      "himself,--\n",

      "The cobbler's face contracted, under the shade he wore over his eyes.\n",
      "An evil smile overspread the lawyer's countenance. A little time\n",

      "The genuineness of the change which had come over Sam Kimper slowly\n",
      "became the subject of general conversation in Bruceton. Judge Prency\n",
      "frequently spoke of it; so did his wife; and, as the Prencys were\n",
      "leaders of village society, whatever interested them became the\n",
      "fashion. People with shoes which needed repairing visited the new\n",
      "cobbler in great numbers, each prompted as much by curiosity as by\n",
      "business, for they seldom haggled about prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam's family, too, began to receive some attention. Mrs. Prency, having\n",

      "Sunday-school if they could be decently clad, interested several ladies\n",
      "to the extent of bestowing some old clothing, which she hired a sewing\n",

      "post-office talked of the town's only ex-convict who had not yet gone\n",
      "back to his old ways. Most of the men who talked of him did it in about\n",
      "the manner of spectators of the gladiatorial combats in ancient Rome:\n",
      "they admired the endurance and courage of the man, but seldom did it\n",
      "occur to them to stretch out a hand to help him. There were exceptions\n",
      "to this rule, however. An old farmer who had brought a load of wheat to\n",

      "was along by his place this mornin', an' seen him carryin' in the last\n",

      "cold-blooded creature; the baby was somewhat ailing; it would not do\n",
      "for the fire to go out, yet the fuel he had carried in at morn could\n",
      "not more than last until evening. The little money that had come into\n",
      "the shop during the day would barely purchase some plain food, of which\n",
      "there was never in the house a day's supply. He had not the courage to\n",

      "Suddenly, when the sun was almost down, Sam remembered that a house was\n",

      "\"Yes, I suppose so. It would be all the same, I guess, if I didn't say\n",

      "\n",
      "Sam pocketed the insult, though the weight of it was heavy. So was that\n",
      "of the bits of board he gathered; but he knew that such thin wood\n",
      "burned rapidly, so he took a load that made him stagger. As he entered\n",
      "the yard behind his house, he saw, through the dusk which was beginning\n",
      "to gather, a man rapidly tossing cord-wood from a wagon to a large pile\n",
      "which already lay on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friend,\" gasped Sam, dropping his own load and panting from his\n",
      "exertion, \"I guess--you've made a--mistake. I ain't ordered a load of\n",
      "wood from nobody. Guess you've come to the wrong house.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Guess not,\" replied the man, who was the farmer that had freed his\n",
      "mind at the railway station during the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "and threw it on the ground; then he threw another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Won't you tell me who sent it?\" Sam asked again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farmer turned his head and shouted,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"God Almighty, if you must know; and He told me to bring that bag of\n",

      "\n",

      "sooner was supper ended than the child slipped out of the house and\n",
      "hurried to the hotel to tell her sister Jane all about it. Within half\n",
      "an hour the story had passed, through the usual channels, to all\n",
      "lounging-places that were open, and at one of them--the post-office--it\n",
      "was heard by Deacon Quickset. It troubled the good man a great deal,\n",
      "and he said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no knowing how much harm'll be done the fellow by that speech.\n",
      "If he thinks the Lord is going to take care of him in such unexpected\n",
      "ways, he'll go to loafing and then get back into his old ways.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't the Lord ever help you in any unexpected way, deacon?\" asked\n",
      "Judge Prency, who nearly every evening spent a few moments in the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, yes,--of course; but, judge, Sam and I aren't exactly the same\n",
      "kind of men, I think you'll allow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite right,\" said the judge. \"You're a man of sense and character.\n",
      "But when Jesus was on earth did He give much attention to men of your\n",
      "general character and standing? According to my memory of the\n",
      "record,--and I've re-read it several times since Sam Kimper's\n",
      "return,--He confined His attentions quite closely to the poor and\n",
      "wretched, apparently to the helpless, worthless class to whom the\n",
      "Kimper family would have belonged had it lived at that time. 'They that\n",
      "are whole need no physician,'--you remember?--'but they that are\n",
      "sick.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"According to the way you seem to be thinking, Judge Prency,\" said the\n",

      "them that's most shiftless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Those who deserve most are those who need most, aren't they,\n",
      "deacon?--that is, if anyone is really 'deserving,' as we use the word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your notions would break up business entirely, if they were carried\n",
      "out,\" asserted the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all; though I've never discovered that business is the first\n",
      "interest of the Almighty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean to say that because I work hard and get a little fore-handed\n",
      "I ought to take a lot of shiftless folks and teach them to be lazy and\n",
      "dependent on me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not, deacon. How you do jump at conclusions! There aren't a\n",
      "lot of shiftless people in this town; there are very few; and even they\n",
      "might be helped, and shamed into taking care of themselves, if you and\n",
      "I and some more fore-handed people were to follow our Master's\n",
      "example.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've spoken to every unbeliever in this town about his soul's\n",
      "salvation,\" said the deacon; \"I've always made it a matter of duty.\n",
      "Christ came to preach salvation, and I'm following His example, in my\n",
      "humble way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't He do anything else?\" asked the judge. \"You remember what\n",
      "answer He sent to John in prison, when the Baptist seemed to have lost\n",
      "heart and wondered whether Jesus were really He who should come? He\n",
      "said that to the poor the gospel was preached, but He gave half a dozen\n",
      "other proofs, each of them showing special care for men's bodies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Judge, you're talking materialism,\" said the deacon. \"It's a spirit\n",
      "that's getting too common everywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, I'm not; I'm talking the words of Jesus Himself. Aren't they\n",
      "good enough for you? or are you like children at the table who will\n",
      "take only what suits them, and ignore everything else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such talks never do any good, judge,\" said the deacon, buttoning his\n",
      "overcoat and turning up the collar. \"I've spent a good deal of my life\n",
      "thinking about sacred subjects and trying to lead my fellow-men in the\n",
      "right way. You're not going to make me believe at my time of life that\n",
      "I've been all wrong, and that Jesus Christ came on earth only to start\n",
      "a charity society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor to teach people to live right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants them first to know how to die right. I should think, judge,\n",

      "backwards. That fellow has only got hold of one end of the\n",
      "Scripture--one little jag end of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too small an end to be worthy of your attention, I suppose, deacon?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "CHAPTER XI.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One bright, breezy October afternoon, Sam Kimper's daughter Jane got\n",
      "\"an hour off\" from her duties at the hotel, and proceeded to devote it\n",
      "to her highest ideal of possible enjoyment. There were many other\n",
      "pleasures for which she longed, but, as they were unattainable just\n",
      "then, she made the most of that which was within her reach for the time\n",
      "being. It was to array herself in her best and saunter to and fro in\n",
      "the principal streets, look into shop windows, and exchange winks and\n",
      "rude remarks with young men and women with whom she was acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although her attire was about what one would expect of a drunkard's\n",
      "child who had spent her later years in the kitchen and corridors of a\n",
      "hotel, Jane was not an unsightly creature. There must have been good\n",
      "physical quality in one side or other of her family, in past\n",
      "generations, which was trying to reappear, for Jane had a fine figure,\n",
      "expressive eyes, and a good complexion. Had any one followed her during\n",
      "her afternoon stroll, and observed her closely during her successive\n",
      "chance meetings with young men and women of her acquaintance, he would\n",
      "have seen hard lines, coarse lines, ugly lines, in her face; yet when\n",
      "in repose the same face was neither unwomanly nor without an occasional\n",
      "suggestion of soul. It was a face like many others that one may see on\n",
      "the streets,--entirely human, yet entirely under the control of\n",
      "whatever influence might be about it for the time being,--the face of a\n",
      "nature untrained and untaught, which would have followed either Jesus\n",
      "or Satan, or both by turns, had both appeared before it in visible\n",
      "shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a moment or two of her afternoon out, Jane found herself\n",
      "approaching Mrs. Prency and Eleanor, those ladies being out on one of\n",
      "those serious errands known collectively as \"shopping.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do see that dreadfully dowdy girl!\" exclaimed Miss Eleanor, whose\n",
      "attire was always selected with correct taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She has never had any one to teach her to dress properly, my dear,\"\n",
      "suggested the mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She might have some one who cared enough for her to keep her from\n",
      "appearing in public in red hair and a blue ribbon,\" said the daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such girls have no one to keep them from doing anything they like, my\n",
      "dear. Let us try to be sorry for them, instead of being disgusted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, mother--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sh-h! she'll hear you. I'm going to bow to her; I wish you'd do the\n",
      "same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To oblige me; I'll explain afterwards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The couple were now within several steps of Jane, who, with an odd\n",
      "mixture of wistfulness and scare, had been studying Eleanor's attire.\n",
      "When she saw both women looking at her, she began to take a defiant\n",
      "attitude, but the toss of her head was met by one of Mrs. Prency's\n",
      "heartiest smiles, accompanied by a similar recognition from Eleanor.\n",
      "Short as was the time that could elapse before the couple had passed\n",
      "her, it was long enough to show a change in Jane's face,--a change so\n",
      "notable that Eleanor whispered,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you ever see any one alter looks so quickly?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never; but I sha'n't lose any opportunity to see it again,\" said Mrs.\n",
      "Prency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, dear,\" said Eleanor, \"I hope you're not suddenly going to\n",
      "recognize every common person you may meet on the street. You're so\n",
      "enthusiastic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so different from my daughter in that respect,--eh, dear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, mother, you've always been so careful and fastidious about your\n",
      "associations and mine. I remember the time, only a year or two ago,\n",
      "while I was at school, when you would have been horrified if I'd had\n",
      "anything to do with a creature like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were a child then, my dear; you're a woman now. That girl is the\n",
      "daughter of the poor fellow--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam Kimper?--that you and father talk of so frequently? Yes, I know;\n",
      "she was a horrid little thing in school, two classes below me. But,\n",
      "mother, I don't see why we ought to recognize her just because her\n",
      "father has been in the penitentiary and behaved himself since he came\n",
      "back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because she _needs_ recognition, dear child; because she gets it from\n",
      "plenty of people of her own class, and if she has it from no others she\n",
      "never will be any better than she is; perhaps she will become worse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, mother!\" exclaimed Eleanor, with a toss of her handsome head,\n",
      "\"such people never change. There were plenty of such girls in the same\n",
      "class with me in the public school, and they've all gone off and\n",
      "married common low fellows. Some of them were real pretty girls while\n",
      "they were young, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the more reason why others of the same kind should have some\n",
      "encouragement to do better, my child.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, mother,\" persisted Eleanor, \"what possible good will it do that\n",
      "Kimper girl for us merely to recognize her in the street?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may do as much more for her as you choose, if you think mere\n",
      "courtesy is not enough. Eleanor, you are a healthy, happy girl; you\n",
      "know--and I remember--all a girl's natural fancies and longings. Do you\n",
      "imagine that being badly born and reared can keep that girl from having\n",
      "the same feelings? She probably wishes she could dress as well as the\n",
      "best, attract attention, be respected, have a real fine fellow fall in\n",
      "love with her--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea!\" exclaimed Eleanor, laughing merrily. \"But suppose it were\n",
      "all true; how can mere notice from us help her? I'm sure the minute we\n",
      "passed her she made a face and envied me my better clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will think differently when you have more experience, my dear.\n",
      "When I was as young as you, I thought--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, mother, there she is again,\" said Eleanor, \"crossing the street;\n",
      "she's turning right towards us. And,\" murmured the young lady, after\n",
      "assuring herself that it was really the same combination of red hair\n",
      "and blue ribbon, \"how different she looks!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because two women of some standing and position chanced to notice\n",
      "her. Let's help the good work along, daughter.\" Then, before Miss\n",
      "Eleanor had time to object, and just as the cobbler's daughter was in\n",
      "front of them, Mrs. Prency stopped, extended her neatly gloved hand,\n",
      "and said, with a pleasant smile,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How these girls do grow! You were little Jane only a year or two ago,\n",
      "Miss Kimper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Never before had Jane Kimper been addressed as \"Miss.\" The appellation\n",
      "sent color flying into her face and brightness into her eyes as she\n",
      "stammered out something about growing being natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You haven't grown fast enough, though, to neglect good looks,\"\n",
      "continued Mrs. Prency, while Eleanor, endeavoring to act according to\n",
      "her mother's injunctions, drawled,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the cobbler's daughter flushed deeper and looked grateful, almost\n",
      "modest, for girls read girls pretty fairly, and Jane saw that Eleanor\n",
      "was regarding her face with real admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You girls of the new generation can't imagine how much interest we\n",
      "women who used to be girls have in you,\" said the judge's wife. \"I'm\n",
      "afraid you'd be vain if you knew how much Eleanor and I have looked at\n",
      "you and talked about you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't s'pose any lady that was anybody ever thought anything about\n",
      "girls like me,\" Jane finally managed to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're greatly mistaken, my dear girl,\" said the lady. \"Nearly every\n",
      "one in this world talks a good deal about every one else whom they know\n",
      "by sight. You really can't imagine how much good it does me to see you\n",
      "looking so well and pretty. Keep right on looking so, won't you? The\n",
      "girls of to-day must be our women a few years hence; that's what I keep\n",
      "impressing upon my daughter day by day,--don't I, dear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you do, mother.\" Eleanor said it with a look at Jane which was\n",
      "almost a signal for sympathy: the cobbler's daughter was greatly\n",
      "mystified by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see,\" said Jane, after standing awkwardly for a moment in\n",
      "meditation, \"how a girl's goin' to be much of a woman that amounts to\n",
      "anything one of these days if she's nothin' to do now but dirty work at\n",
      "a hotel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe she could change her work,\" suggested the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's lips parted into some hard and ugly lines, and she replied,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some things is easier sayin' than doin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Should you like a different position?\" asked Mrs. Prency. \"I'm sure it\n",
      "could be had if people knew you wanted it. For instance, I need some\n",
      "one every day for weeks to come to help my daughter and me with our\n",
      "sewing and fitting. There are always so many things to be done as\n",
      "winter approaches. I sometimes feel as if I were chained to my\n",
      "sewing-machine, and have so much to do. But I'm afraid such work would\n",
      "seem very stupid to you. It would mean sitting still all day, you know,\n",
      "with no one to talk to but Eleanor and me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked wonderingly at the two women before her. No one but them to\n",
      "talk to! She never had imagined an opportunity to talk to such people\n",
      "at all. She supposed all such women regarded her as part of the scum of\n",
      "the earth, yet here they were speaking pleasantly to her,--Mrs. Prency,\n",
      "a woman who naturally would fill the eye of an impulsive animal like\n",
      "Jane,--Eleanor, the belle of the town,--two women whom no one could\n",
      "look at without admiration. No one but them to talk to! All her\n",
      "associates faded from Jane's mind like a fleck of mist under a\n",
      "sunburst, as she answered,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there's anything you want done that I can do, Mrs. Prency, I'd\n",
      "rather work for you for nothin' than for anybody else for any money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come to my house as soon as you like, then, and we'll promise to keep\n",
      "you busy: won't we, daughter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" murmured Eleanor, who saw, in her mind's eye, a great\n",
      "deal of her work being done without effort of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You sha'n't do it for nothing, however; you shall earn fully as much\n",
      "as you do now. Good day,\" Mrs. Prency said, as she passed on, and\n",
      "Eleanor gave Jane a nod and a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel drudge stood still and looked after the couple with wondering\n",
      "eyes. The judge's wife dropped something as she walked. Jane hurried\n",
      "after her and picked it up. It was a glove. The girl pressed it to her\n",
      "lips again and again, hurried along for a few steps to return it,\n",
      "stopped suddenly, thrust it into her breast, and then, passing the back\n",

      "\n",
      "Reynolds Bartram and Eleanor Prency rapidly became so fond of each\n",
      "other that the people of the village predicted an early engagement. The\n",
      "young man had become quite a regular attendant at church,--not that he\n",
      "had any religious feeling whatever, but that it enabled him to look at\n",
      "his sweetheart for an hour and a half every Sunday morning and walk\n",
      "home with her afterwards. Although he had considerable legal practice,\n",
      "it was somehow always his fortune to be on the street when the young\n",
      "lady chanced to be out shopping, and after he joined her there\n",
      "generally ensued a walk which had nothing whatever to do with shopping\n",
      "or anything else except an opportunity for two young people to talk to\n",
      "each other for a long time on subjects which seemed extremely\n",
      "interesting to both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, there were occasional clouds upon their sky. The young\n",
      "man who loves his sweetheart better than he loves himself occasionally\n",
      "appears in novels, but in real life he seems to be an unknown quantity,\n",
      "and young Bartram was no exception to the general rule. In like\n",
      "manner, the young woman who loses sight of her own will, even when in\n",
      "the society of the man whom she thinks the most adorable in the world,\n",
      "is not easy to discover in any ordinary circle of acquaintances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartram and Eleanor met one afternoon, in their customary manner, on\n",
      "the principal street of the village, and walked along side by side for\n",
      "quite a way, finally turning and sauntering through several residence\n",
      "streets, talking with each other on a number of subjects, probably of\n",
      "no great consequence, but apparently very interesting to both of them.\n",
      "Suddenly, however, it was the young man's misfortune to see the two\n",
      "Kimper boys on the opposite side of the street, and as he eyed them,\n",
      "his lip curled, and he said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it somewhat strange that your estimable parents are so greatly\n",
      "interested in the father of those wretched scamps?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing that my father and mother do, Mr. Bartram,\" said Miss Prency,\n",
      "\"is at all strange. They are quite as intelligent as anyone of my\n",
      "acquaintance, I am sure, and more so than most people whom I know, and\n",
      "I have no doubt that their interest in the poor fellow has very good\n",
      "grounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps so,\" said the young man, with another curl of his lip, which\n",
      "exasperated his companion. \"I sometimes wonder, however, whether men\n",
      "and women, when they reach middle life and have been reasonably\n",
      "successful and happy in their own affairs, are not likely to allow\n",
      "their sympathies to run away with their intelligence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be so,\" said Eleanor, \"among people of your acquaintance, as a\n",
      "class, but I wish you distinctly to except my parents from the rule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, my dear girl,\" said the young man, \"your parents are exactly the\n",
      "people to whom I am alluding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then do me the favor to change the subject of conversation,\" said the\n",
      "young lady proudly: \"I never allow my parents to be criticised in my\n",
      "hearing by anyone but myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" said the young man, \"if you choose to take my remarks in\n",
      "that way, I presume you are at liberty to do so; but I am sure you are\n",
      "misunderstanding me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see how it is possible to misunderstand anything that is said\n",
      "so very distinctly: you lawyers have a faculty, Mr. Bartram, of saying\n",
      "exactly what you mean--when you choose to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I can't deny that I meant exactly what I said.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you can at least change the subject, can't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, if you insist upon it; but the subject has been\n",
      "interesting me considerably of late, and I am really wondering whether\n",
      "my estimable friend, the judge, and his no less estimable wife may not\n",
      "be making a mistake which their daughter would be the most effective\n",
      "person in rectifying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do me altogether too much honor, sir. Suppose you attempt to\n",
      "rectify their mistakes yourself, since you seem so positive about their\n",
      "existence. To give you an opportunity of preparing yourself to do so, I\n",
      "will bid you good day.\" Saying which, the young woman abruptly turned\n",
      "into the residence of an acquaintance to make an afternoon call,\n",
      "leaving the young man rather more disconcerted than he would have liked\n",
      "to admit to any of his acquaintances.\n",
      "\n",
      "He retraced his steps, moodily muttering to himself, and apparently\n",
      "arguing also, for the forefinger of one hand was occasionally touching\n",
      "the palm of the other, and, apparently without knowing in what\n",
      "direction he was walking, he found himself opposite the shop of the\n",
      "shoemaker who had been the indirect cause of his quarrel with his\n",
      "sweetheart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Confound that fellow!\" muttered Bartram, \"he's in my way wherever I\n",
      "move. I've heard too much of him in the stores and the courts and\n",
      "everywhere else that I have been obliged to go. I have to hear of him\n",
      "at the residence of my own sweetheart whenever I call there, and now I\n",
      "find Eleanor herself, who has never been able to endure any of the\n",
      "commoner specimens of humanity, apparently taking up the cudgels in his\n",
      "defence. I wish I could understand the fascination that fellow exerts\n",
      "over a number of people so much better than himself. Hang it! I am\n",
      "going to find out. He is a fool, if ever there was one, and I am not.\n",
      "If I can't get at the secret of it, it will be the first time that I\n",
      "have ever been beaten in examining and cross-examining such a common\n",
      "specimen of humanity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus speaking, the lawyer crossed the street and entered the shop, but,\n",
      "to his disgust, found both the cobbler's sons there with their father.\n",
      "The boys, with a curiosity common to all very young people, and\n",
      "particularly intense among the classes who have nothing in particular\n",
      "to think of, stared at him so fixedly that he finally rose abruptly and\n",
      "departed without saying a word. The boys went out soon after, and Billy\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course I do. He's always wantin' folks to work, an' always findin'\n",

      "you can to help him?' an' I kind o' felt ashamed, an' all I could say\n",
      "was that I didn't see nothin' I could help him about, an' she said she\n",

      "with his foot towards the baby, who had crawled about the floor until\n",
      "it was weary and fretful and was uttering plaintive cries from time to\n",
      "time. His mother was out of the house somewhere, and the baby continued\n",
      "to protest against its physical discomforts until Tom indulged in a\n",
      "violent expletive, which had the effect of temporarily silencing the\n",
      "child and causing it to look up at him with wondering eyes. Tom\n",
      "returned the infant's stare for a moment or two, and then, moved by\n",
      "some spirit which he was not able to identify, he stooped and picked\n",
      "up the infant and sat down in a chair. When his mother returned, she\n",

      "down to the shop, and dragged her husband away and back to his home.\n",
      "When the door was opened, Sam Kimper was almost paralyzed to see his\n",

      "safety and to lay hold of the horns of the altar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said Dr. Guide to his deacon, \"the conversation I had\n",
      "with that rather unusual character has led me to believe that he is\n",
      "quite as safe at present as any of the members of my own congregation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, doctor, doctor!\" groaned the deacon, \"that will never do! What is\n",
      "the church to come to if everybody is to be allowed to believe just\n",
      "what he wants to, and stop just when he gets ready, and not go any\n",
      "further unless he understands everything before him? I don't need to\n",
      "tell you, a minister of the gospel and a doctor of divinity, that we\n",
      "have to live by faith and not by sight. I don't have to go over all the\n",
      "points of belief to a man of your character to show you what a mistake\n",
      "you are making, thinking that way about a poor common fellow that's\n",
      "only got one idea in his head,--one that might be shaken out of it very\n",
      "easily.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deacon,\" said the minister, \"I am strongly of the impression that any\n",
      "belief of any member of my congregation could be as easily shaken as\n",
      "the one article of faith to which that poor fellow has bound himself. I\n",
      "don't propose to disturb his mind any further. 'Milk for babes,' you\n",
      "know the apostle says, 'and strong meat for men.' After he has proved\n",
      "himself to be equal to meat, there will be ample time to experiment\n",
      "with some of the dry bones which you seem anxious that I should force\n",
      "upon him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Guide,\" said the deacon, with considerable dignity, \"I didn't\n",
      "expect this kind of talk from you. I have been sitting under your\n",
      "ministrations a good many years, and, though sometimes I didn't think\n",
      "you were as sharp-set as you ought to be, still I knew you were a man\n",
      "of level head and good education and knew everything that was essential\n",
      "to salvation; otherwise, why did the best college of our own\n",
      "denomination make you a doctor of divinity? But I've got to let out\n",
      "what is in my heart, doctor, and it is this, that there is no\n",
      "stopping-place for any one that begins to walk the straight and narrow\n",
      "way; he has got to keep on as long as he lives, and if he don't he is\n",

      "object to putting any stumbling-blocks in any such person's way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to say, Dr. Guide,\" asked the deacon, earnestly, \"that all\n",
      "the articles of faith that you have always taught us were essential to\n",
      "salvation are to be looked at as stumbling-blocks when they are offered\n",
      "to somebody like that poor dying sinner?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean exactly that, deacon,\" said the minister, \"and I mean still\n",
      "more, and I mean to preach earnestly on the subject in a short time,\n",
      "and at considerable length, that they have been stumbling-blocks to a\n",
      "great many members of my congregation who should by this time be better\n",
      "men and women than they are. For instance, deacon,\" said the minister,\n",
      "suddenly, looking very stern and judicial, \"Mrs. Poynter has been to me\n",
      "several times to explain that the reason that she does not pay her\n",
      "subscription to the last collection for the Missionary Association is\n",
      "that she cannot get the interest on the mortgage that you have been\n",
      "holding for her for a long time, and which, she says, you have\n",
      "collected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dr. Guide,\" said the deacon, icily, \"religion is religion, and\n",
      "business is business. You understand religion--to a certain extent;\n",
      "though I must own that I don't think you understand it as far as I once\n",
      "thought you did. But about business, you must excuse me if I say you\n",
      "don't know anything, especially if it's business that somebody else has\n",
      "to carry on. If Mrs. Poynter don't like the way I'm doing business for\n",
      "her, she knows a way to get rid of me, and she can do it easily\n",
      "enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deacon,\" said the minister, \"I don't wish to offend you, but matters\n",
      "of this sort may develop into a scandal, and injure the cause for which\n",
      "both of us profess to be working with all our hearts. And, by the way,\n",
      "the Browning children are likely to be sent away from the academy at\n",
      "which they are boarding, because their expenses are not paid, according\n",
      "to the terms of the trust reposed in you by their father. I have been\n",
      "written to several times by the principal, who is an old friend of\n",
      "mine. Can't the matter be arranged in some way so that I shall not hear\n",
      "any more about it? I have no possible method of replying in a manner\n",
      "that will satisfy the principal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell him to write to me, doctor; tell him to write to me. He has no\n",
      "business to put such affairs before anybody else. He will get his\n",
      "money. If he didn't believe it, he wouldn't have taken the children in\n",
      "the first place. But I will see that you don't hear any more about\n",
      "either of these matters, and, as I am pretty busy and don't get a\n",
      "chance to see you as often as I'd like, I want to say that it seems to\n",
      "me that now is just the time to get up a warmer feeling in the church.\n",
      "It's getting cold weather, and folks are glad to get together in a warm\n",
      "room where there's anything going on. Now, if you will just announce\n",
      "next Sunday that there's going to be a series of special meetings to\n",
      "awaken religious interest in this town, I think you will do a good deal\n",
      "more good among those who need it than by worrying members of your own\n",
      "congregation about things that you don't understand. I don't mean any\n",
      "offence, and I hope you won't take any; but when a man is trying to do\n",
      "business for a dozen other folks and they are all at him at once, there\n",
      "are many things happening that he can't very well explain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I already had determined on a special effort at an early date,\" said\n",
      "the pastor. \"And still more: after two or three conversations with the\n",
      "man whom you were so desirous that I should call upon, I have\n",
      "determined to invite him to assist me in the conduct of the meetings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?\" exclaimed the deacon, \"bring in that thief and drunkard and\n",
      "ignorant fellow, that is only just out of jail, to teach the way of\n",
      "life to people that need to know it? Why, Dr. Guide, you must be losing\n",
      "your mind!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you intimated about your own business affairs, deacon, that is a\n",
      "subject upon which I am better qualified to judge than you. The\n",
      "meetings will be held, and Mr. Kimper will be asked to assist. In fact,\n",
      "I already have asked him. I trust that his presence will not cause us\n",
      "to lose such valuable assistance as you yourself may be able to give.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I never!\" exclaimed the deacon; \"I never did! It beats all! Why,\n",
      "if there was another church of our denomination in this town, I believe\n",
      "I'd take my letters and go to it. I really would!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the special meetings were immediately announced, and they\n",
      "began directly afterwards, and, according to the pastor's announcement,\n",
      "the ex-convict was asked to assist. His assistance did not seem to\n",
      "amount to much to those who came through curiosity to listen. But after\n",
      "he had made a speech, which, at the suggestion of Dr. Guide, had been\n",
      "carefully prepared, but which was merely a rehearsal of what he already\n",
      "had said to numerous individual questioners, there was impressive\n",
      "silence in the lecture-room, in which the meetings were to be\n",
      "conducted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My friends,\" said the pastor, rising soon afterwards, \"when our Lord\n",
      "was on earth, He once raised His eyes to heaven and said, 'I thank\n",
      "thee, Father, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent\n",
      "and revealed them unto babes.' I confess to you that I never was able\n",
      "to understand the full meaning of this expression; but, as I have\n",
      "become more and more acquainted with our friend who has just spoken to\n",
      "you, and have learned how fully his faith is grounded, and how entirely\n",
      "his life has been changed by what seems to us the mere beginnings of a\n",
      "religious belief, I am constrained to feel that I have yet a great deal\n",
      "to learn about my own profession and my own duty as a minister. What\n",
      "has just been said to you contains the essence of everything which I\n",
      "have tried to preach from my pulpit in twenty years. I wish it were in\n",
      "my power to re-state it all as clearly as you have heard it this\n",
      "evening, but I confess it is not. I fear to add anything to what you\n",
      "have already heard, for I do not see how in any way I could make this\n",
      "important subject any more clear to your comprehension. I will\n",
      "therefore say no more, but ask, as is the custom, that anyone here\n",
      "present who desires to change his life and wishes the assistance of the\n",
      "prayers of God's people will please rise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As is usual in all such meetings, there was a general turning of heads\n",
      "from one side to the other. In an instant a single figure in the midst\n",
      "of the little congregation arose, and a second later a hoarse voice\n",
      "from one of the back seats, a voice which most persons present could\n",
      "identify as that of Sam Kimper's son Tom, exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great Lord! it's Reynolds Bartram!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The story that Reynolds Bartram had \"stood up for prayers\" went through\n",
      "Bruceton and the surrounding country like wildfire. Scarcely anyone\n",
      "believed it, no matter by whom he was told: the informer might be a\n",
      "person of undoubted character, but the information was simply\n",
      "incredible. People would not believe such a thing unless they could see\n",
      "it with their own eyes and hear it with their own ears: so the special\n",
      "meetings became at once so largely attended that they were held in the\n",
      "body of the church instead of the little basement called the\n",
      "\"lecture-room.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The most entirely amazed person in the town was Deacon Quickset. Never\n",
      "before had he been absent, unless sick, from any special effort of his\n",
      "church to persuade the sinners to flee from the wrath to come; but when\n",
      "Dr. Guide announced that he should ask Sam Kimper to assist him in the\n",
      "special meetings, the deacon's conscience bade him halt and consider.\n",
      "Dr. Guide was wrong,--there could be no doubt of that: would it be\n",
      "right, then, merely for the sake of apparent peace and unity, for him,\n",
      "the deacon, to seem to agree with his pastor's peculiar views? The\n",
      "deacon made it a matter of prayer, and the result was that he remained\n",
      "at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Reynolds Bartram had been the first-fruits of the new special\n",
      "effort was a statement which the deacon denied as soon as he heard it.\n",
      "Frequent repetition of the annoying story soon began to impress him\n",
      "with its probability, and finally a brother deacon, who had been\n",
      "present, set all doubt at rest by the assertion that Bartram had not\n",
      "only been converted, but was assisting at the meetings. When, however,\n",
      "the attending deacon went on to inform his absentee brother that\n",
      "Bartram had attributed his awakening and conversion to the influence of\n",
      "Sam Kimper, Deacon Quickset lost his temper, and exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all a confounded lie! It's a put-up job!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Brother Quickset!\" exclaimed the astonished associate, with a most\n",
      "reproving look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't mean that _you lie_,\" explained the angry defender of the\n",
      "faith. \"If you heard Bartram say it, he _did_ say it, of course. But\n",
      "there's something wrong somewhere. The minister's rather lost his head\n",
      "over Sam Kimper, just because the wretch isn't back in his old ways\n",
      "again, and he's got a new notion in his head about how the gospel ought\n",
      "to be preached. New notions have been plenty enough ever since true\n",
      "religion started; there's always some man or men thinking out things\n",
      "for themselves and forgetting everything else on account of them. There\n",
      "were meddlers of that kind back to the days of the apostles, and\n",
      "goodness knows the history of the church is full of them. They've been\n",
      "so set in their ways that no sort of discipline would cure them;\n",
      "they've even had to be hanged or burned, to save the faith from being\n",
      "knocked to pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, brother Quickset,\" pleaded the other deacon, \"every one knows our\n",
      "pastor isn't that sort of a person. He is an intelligent, thoughtful,\n",
      "unexcitable man, that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just the kind that always makes the worst heretics,\" roared the\n",
      "deacon. \"Wasn't Servetus that kind of a person? And didn't Calvin have\n",
      "to burn him at the stake? I tell you, deacon, it takes a good deal of\n",
      "the horror out of those times when you have a case of the kind come\n",
      "right up before your eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? Somebody being burned?\" exclaimed the other deacon, raising his\n",
      "hands in horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no,\" testily replied the defender of the faith. \"Only somebody\n",
      "that ought to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where does the lying come in, that you were talking about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you just what I believe,\" said Deacon Quickset, dropping his\n",
      "voice and drawing closer to his associate; \"I believe Dr. Guide\n",
      "believes just what he says,--of course nobody's going to doubt that\n",
      "he's sincere,--but when it's come to the pinch he's felt a little\n",
      "shaky. What does any other man do when he finds himself shaky about an\n",
      "important matter of opinion? Why, he consults a lawyer, and gets\n",
      "himself pulled through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you don't mean to say that you think Dr. Guide would go to a rank,\n",
      "persistent disbeliever in anything--but himself--like Ray Bartram, do\n",
      "you, in a matter of this kind?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not? Ministers have often got lawyers to help them when they've\n",
      "been muddled on points of orthodoxy. What the lawyer believes or don't\n",
      "believe hasn't got anything to do with it: it's his business to believe\n",
      "as his client does, and make other folks believe so, too. Ray Bartram\n",
      "is just the sort of a fellow a man would want in such a case. He's got\n",
      "that way of looking as if he knew everything, just like his father had\n",
      "before him, that makes folks give in to him in spite of themselves.\n",
      "Besides, he'll say or do anything to carry his point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't that putting it rather strong, Brother Quickset?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it isn't. Don't I know, I should like to ask? Don't I\n",
      "always hire him myself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" That was the only word the other deacon spoke, but his eyes\n",
      "danced, and he twisted his lips into an odd grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, get out!\" exclaimed the pillar of orthodoxy. \"You needn't take it\n",
      "that way. Of course what I ask him to do is only right: if I didn't\n",
      "think so, I wouldn't ask him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not, brother. But think a moment: do you really believe that\n",
      "any form of professional pride would persuade that young man--proud as\n",
      "Lucifer, and just as conceited and headstrong, a young man who always\n",

      "like Bartram must believe as near the animals as humanity ever is,--to\n",
      "say it was the Christian life of Sam Kimper that convinced him of the\n",
      "supernatural origin and saving power of Christianity?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't believe he put it that way: there must be something else\n",
      "behind it. I'm going to find out for myself and do it at once, too.\n",
      "This sort of nonsense must be stopped. Why, if men go to taking\n",
      "everything Jesus Christ said just as He said it, everything in the\n",

      "Away went Deacon Quickset to Bartram's office, and was so fortunate as\n",
      "to find the lawyer in. He went right at his subject:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, young man, you've been in nice business, haven't you?--trying to\n",
      "go up to the throne of grace right behind a jail-bird, while the\n",
      "leaders and teachers whom the Lord has selected have been spurned by\n",
      "you for years!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reynolds Bartram was too new a convert to have changed his old self and\n",
      "manner to any great extent: so he flushed angrily, and retorted,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thief is about as good as another, Deacon Quickset.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was the deacon's turn to look angry. The two men faced each\n",
      "other for a moment with flashing eyes, lowering brows, and hard-set\n",
      "jaws. The deacon was the first to recover himself: he took a chair, and\n",
      "said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe I haven't heard the story rightly. What I came around for was to\n",
      "get it from first hands. Would you mind telling me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you allude to my conversion?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the deacon, with a look of doubt, \"I suppose that's what we\n",
      "will have to call it, for want of a better word.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a very short story,\" said Bartram, now entirely calm, as he\n",
      "leaned against his desk and folded his arms. \"Like every other man with\n",
      "any brains, I've always been interested in religion, intellectually,\n",
      "and have had to believe that if it was right, as I heard it talked, it\n",
      "had sometimes got away from its Founder in a manner for which there\n",
      "seemed to be no excuse. Everything was being taught by the servants,\n",
      "nothing by the Master. When I want to know your wishes, deacon, about\n",
      "any matter in which we are mutually interested, I do not go to your\n",
      "back door and inquire of your servants: I go to you, direct. But when\n",
      "people--you among the number--have talked to me about religion, they've\n",
      "always talked Peter and Paul and James and John,--never Jesus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Apostle Paul--\" began the deacon, but the lawyer snatched the\n",
      "words from his lips, and continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Apostle Paul was the ablest lawyer that ever lived. I've studied\n",
      "him a good deal, in past days, for style.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful!\" groaned the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in the least,\" said the lawyer, with fine earnestness. \"He was\n",
      "just the man for his place and his time; 'twas his business to explain\n",
      "the new order of things to the hard-headed Jews, of whom he had been\n",
      "so notable a representative, that to convert him it was necessary that\n",
      "he should be knocked senseless and remain so for the space of three\n",
      "days: you remember the circumstance? He was just the man, too, to\n",
      "explain the new religion to the heathens and pagans of his day, for\n",
      "those Greeks and Romans were a brainy lot of people. But why should he\n",
      "have been quoted to me, or any other man in the community? We don't\n",
      "have to be convinced that Jesus lived: we believe it already. The\n",
      "belief has been born in us; it has run through our blood for hundreds\n",
      "of years. Do you know what I've honestly believed for years about a lot\n",
      "of religious men in this town, you among the number? I've believed that\n",
      "Jesus was so good that you've all been making hypocritical excuses,\n",
      "through your theology, to get away from this!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get away from my Saviour!\" gasped the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; you wanted enough of Him to be saved by,--enough to die by;\n",
      "but when it comes to living by him--well, you know perfectly well that\n",
      "you don't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful!\" again groaned the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I heard of that wretched convict taking his Saviour as an\n",
      "exemplar of daily life and conduct, it seemed ridiculous. If better men\n",
      "couldn't do it, how could he? I had no doubt that while he was under\n",
      "lock and key, with no temptations about him, and nothing to resist, he\n",
      "had succeeded; but that he could do it in the face of all his old\n",
      "influences I did not for an instant believe. I began to study him, as I\n",
      "would any other criminal, and when he did not break down as soon as I\n",
      "had expected, I was mean enough--God forgive me!--to try to shake his\n",
      "faith. The honest truth is, I did not want to be a Christian myself,\n",
      "and had resisted all the arguments I had heard; but I was helpless when\n",
      "dear friends told me that nothing was impossible to me that was being\n",
      "accomplished by a common fellow like Sam Kimper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing is impossible to him that believes,\" said the deacon, finding\n",
      "his tongue for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I believe; there was no trouble about that: 'the devils also\n",
      "believe,'--you remember that passage, I suppose? Finally, I began to\n",
      "watch Sam closely, to see if perhaps he wasn't as much of a hypocrite,\n",
      "on the sly, as some other people I know. He can't make much money on\n",
      "the terms he has with Larry, no matter how much work reaches the shop.\n",
      "I've passed his shop scores of times, early and late, and found him\n",
      "always at work, except once or twice when I've seen him on his knees.\n",
      "I've hung about his wretched home nights, to see if he did not sneak\n",
      "out on thieving expeditions; I've asked store-keepers what he bought,\n",
      "and have found that his family lived on the plainest food. That man is\n",
      "a Christian, deacon. When I heard that he was to make an exhortation at\n",
      "the meeting, I went there to listen--only for that purpose. But as he\n",
      "talked I could not help recalling his mean, little, insignificant face\n",
      "as I'd seen it again and again when I was a younger man, dropping into\n",
      "justices' courts for a chance to get practice at pleading, and he was\n",
      "up for fighting or stealing. It was the same face: nothing can ever\n",
      "make his forehead any higher or broader, or put a chin where nature\n",
      "left one off. But the expression of countenance was so different--so\n",
      "honest, so good--that I got from it my first clear idea of what was\n",
      "possible to the man who took our Saviour for a model of daily life. It\n",
      "took such hold of me that when the pastor asked those who wanted the\n",
      "prayers of God's people to rise, I was on my feet in an instant; I\n",
      "couldn't keep my seat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you do admit that there are some God's people besides Sam\n",
      "Kimper?\" sneered the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never doubted it,\" replied the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" said the deacon, \"if you'll go on, now you've begun, you'll\n",
      "see you've only made a beginning. By the way, have you got that Bittles\n",
      "mortgage ready yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the lawyer, \"and I won't have it ready, either. To draw a\n",
      "mortgage in that way, so the property will fall into your hands quickly\n",
      "and Bittles will lose everything, is simple rascality, and I'll have\n",
      "nothing to do with it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right if he's willing to sign it, isn't it?\" asked the\n",
      "deacon, with an ugly frown. \"His signature is put on by his own free\n",
      "will, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know perfectly well, Deacon Quickset,\" said the lawyer, \"that\n",
      "fellows like Bittles will sign anything without looking at it, if they\n",
      "can get a little money to put into some new notion. A man's home should\n",
      "be the most jealously guarded bit of property in the world: I'm not\n",
      "going to deceive any man into losing it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't suppose,\" said the deacon, \"that getting religious would take\n",
      "away your respect for the law, and make you above the law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't: it makes me resolve that the law shan't be used for\n",
      "purposes of the devil.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean to call me the devil?\" screamed the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not calling you anything: I'm speaking of the unrighteous act you\n",
      "want done. I won't do it for you; and, further, I'll put Bittles on his\n",
      "guard against any one else who may try it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bartram,\" said the deacon, rising, \"I guess I'll have to take all\n",
      "my law-business to somebody else. Good-morning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't suppose I should have to suffer for my principles so soon,\"\n",

      "all your affairs a little while.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Eleanor Prency heard that her lover had not only been converted\n",
      "but was taking an active part in the special religious meetings, she\n",
      "found herself in what the old women of the vicinity called a \"state of\n",
      "mind.\" She did not object to young men becoming very good; that is, she\n",
      "did object to any young man of whom she happened to be very fond\n",
      "becoming very bad. But it seemed to her that there was a place where\n",
      "the line should be drawn, and that Reynolds Bartram had overstepped it.\n",
      "That he might sometime join the church was a possibility to which she\n",
      "had previously looked forward with some pleasurable sense of\n",
      "anticipation. She belonged to the church herself, so did her father and\n",
      "mother, and she had long been of the opinion that a little religion was\n",
      "a very good thing for a young man who was in business and subject to\n",
      "temptation. But, as she regarded the events of the past few evenings as\n",
      "reported by people who had been to the meetings, she became more than\n",
      "ever of the opinion that a little religion would go a long way, and\n",
      "that Reynolds Bartram had more than was necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add to her annoyance, some of her intimate acquaintances who knew\n",
      "that if the two young people were not engaged they certainly were very\n",
      "fond of each other, and who regarded the match as a matter of course in\n",
      "the near future, began to twit her on the possibility of her lover\n",
      "becoming a minister should he go on in his present earnest course of\n",
      "trying to save lost souls. The more they talked about her, in her\n",
      "presence, as a minister's wife, the less she enjoyed the prospect.\n",
      "Minister's wives in Bruceton were sometimes pretty, but they never\n",
      "dressed very well, and Miss Eleanor was sure, from what she saw of\n",
      "their lives, that they never had any good times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuel was added to the fire of her discontent when her mother announced\n",
      "one morning that Jane Kimper had arrived and would assist the couple at\n",
      "their sewing. To Eleanor, Jane represented the Kimper family, the head\n",
      "of which was the cause of Reynolds Bartram's extraordinary course.\n",
      "Eleanor blamed Sam for all the discomfort to which she had been\n",
      "subjected on account of Bartram's religious aspirations, and she was\n",
      "inclined to visit upon the new seamstress the blame for all the\n",
      "annoyances from which she had suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a great many other girls who are quite affectionate daughters, she\n",
      "neglected to make a confidante of her mother; and Mrs. Prency was\n",
      "therefore very much surprised, on entering the room after a short\n",
      "shopping-tour, to discover the two young women in utter silence,\n",
      "Eleanor looking greatly vexed and the new sewing-woman very much\n",
      "distressed about something. The older lady endeavored to engage the\n",
      "couple in conversation. After waiting a little while for the situation\n",
      "to make itself manifest, but getting only very short replies, she left\n",
      "the room and made an excuse to call her daughter after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear child, what is the matter? Doesn't Jane know how to sew?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Eleanor, \"I suppose so; but she knows how to talk, too, and\n",
      "she has done it so industriously and made me feel so uncomfortable that\n",
      "I have not had any opportunity to examine her sewing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My daughter, what can she have said to annoy you so much?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" exclaimed Eleanor, savagely snatching to pieces a bit of delicate\n",
      "silk she held in her hand, \"what every one else is talking about. What\n",
      "does any one in this town have to talk about just now, I wonder, except\n",
      "Reynolds Bartram and the church? Why is it that they all think it\n",
      "necessary to come and talk to me about it? I am sure I am not specially\n",
      "interested in church work, and I don't believe any one who has talked\n",
      "to me about it is, but I hear nothing else from morning till night\n",
      "when any visitor comes in. I was congratulating myself that I had an\n",
      "excuse to-day, so that I need not see any one who might call, but that\n",
      "dreadful girl is worse than all the rest put together. She seems to\n",
      "think, as her folks at home haven't anything else to talk about, and as\n",
      "her father is so delighted at the 'blessed change,' as she expresses\n",
      "it, that has come over Bartram, that I should feel just as happy about\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, daughter, don't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, mother, I don't. I suppose it's perfectly dreadful in me to say\n",
      "so, but I don't feel anything of the kind. It's just horrid; and I wish\n",
      "you and father would take me away for a little while, or else let me go\n",
      "off on a visit. People talk as if Ray belonged entirely to me,--as if I\n",
      "had something to do about it; and you know perfectly well I haven't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, dear, is that any reason why you should be jealous of poor Sam\n",
      "Kimper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Jealous!\" exclaimed Eleanor, her eyes flashing: \"he is the worst enemy\n",
      "I ever had. I haven't had so much annoyance and trouble in all my life\n",
      "as have come to me during the past two or three days through that\n",
      "wretched man. I wish him almost any harm. I even wish he had never gone\n",
      "to the penitentiary\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Prency burst out laughing. The young woman saw the blunder she\n",
      "had committed, and continued, quickly,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean that I wish he had never got out again. The idea of a fellow\n",
      "like that coming back to this town and talking and working on people's\n",
      "sympathies in such a way as to carry intelligent people right off their\n",
      "feet! Here you and father have been talking about him at the table\n",
      "almost every day for a long time!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, daughter, you seemed interested in everything we said, and\n",
      "thought he might do a great deal of good if he were sincere and\n",
      "remained true to his professions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Great deal of good? Yes; but, of course, I supposed he'd do it among\n",
      "his own set of people. I had no idea that he was going to invade the\n",
      "upper classes of society and make a guy out of the very young man\n",
      "that--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eleanor burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear child,\" said the mother, \"you are making altogether too much\n",
      "of very little. Of course, it's impossible that everybody in the town\n",
      "sha'n't be surprised at the sudden change that has come over Mr.\n",
      "Bartram, but it ought to comfort you to know that all the better people\n",
      "in the town are very glad to learn of it, and that his example is\n",
      "making them very much ashamed of themselves, and that, instead of the\n",
      "meetings being conducted almost entirely by him and Sam Kimper,\n",
      "hereafter--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Him and Sam Kimper! Mother! the idea of mentioning the two persons in\n",
      "the same day!--in the same breath! How can you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, dear, they will no longer manage the meetings by themselves, but\n",
      "a number of the older citizens, who have generally held aloof from such\n",
      "affairs, have resolved that it is time for them to do something, so\n",
      "Reynolds will very soon be a less prominent figure, and I trust you\n",
      "will hear less about him. But don't--I beg of you, don't visit your\n",
      "displeasure on that poor girl. You can't imagine that she had anything\n",
      "to do with her father's conversion, can you, still less with that of\n",
      "Mr. Bartram? Now, do dry your eyes and try to come back to your work\n",
      "and be cheerful. If you can't do more, you at least can be human. Don't\n",
      "disgrace your parentage, my dear. _She_ has not even done that as yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mrs. Prency returned to the sewing-room and chatted a little while\n",
      "with the new seamstress about the work in hand. Eleanor joined them in\n",
      "a few moments, and the mental condition of the atmosphere became\n",
      "somewhat less cloudy than before, when suddenly a stupid servant, who\n",
      "had only just been engaged and did not entirely know the ways of the\n",
      "house, ushered directly into the sewing-room Mr. Reynolds Bartram.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleanor sprang to her feet, spreading dress-goods, and needles, and\n",
      "spools of silk, and thread, and scissors, and thimbles, all over the\n",
      "floor. Jane looked up timidly for an instant, and bent her head lower\n",
      "over her work. But Mrs. Prency received him as graciously as if she\n",
      "were the Queen of England sitting upon her throne, with her royal robes\n",
      "upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely dropped in to see the judge, Mrs. Prency. I beg pardon for\n",
      "intruding upon the business of the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose he is at home,\" said the lady. \"You have been at the\n",
      "office?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and I was assured he was here. I was anxious to see him at once.\n",
      "I suspect I have a very heavy case on my hands, Mrs. Prency. What do\n",
      "you suppose I have agreed to do? I have promised, actually promised, to\n",
      "persuade him to come down to the church this evening and take part in\n",
      "the meetings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Eleanor, who had just reseated herself, flashed an indignant look at\n",
      "him. The young man saw it; but if the spirit of regeneration had worked\n",
      "upon him to a sufficient extent to make him properly sensitive to the\n",
      "looks and manners of estimable young women, he showed no sign of it at\n",
      "the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure I wish you well in your effort,\" said the judge's wife;\n",
      "\"and, if it is of any comfort to you, I promise that I will do all in\n",
      "my power to assist you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eleanor's eyes flashed again, as she said,--\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do you know of any one, daughter, whose character more fully justifies\n",
      "him in doing so? If you do, I shall not hesitate to ask Mr. Bartram to\n",
      "act as substitute until some one else can be found.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eleanor's eyes took a very different expression, and she began to\n",
      "devote herself intensely to her sewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you are very sure,\" said Bartram, \"that your husband is not at\n",
      "home, I must seek him elsewhere, I suppose. Good day! Ah, I beg pardon.\n",
      "I did not notice--I was not aware that it was you, Miss Kimper. I hope\n",
      "if you see your father to-day you will tell him that the good work that\n",

      "Judge Prency to help him on with his efforts down at the church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, with another bow, Bartram left the room.\n",

      "leave the room and never enter it again. But she knew nothing of it,\n",
      "and the work went on amid oppressive silence. Mrs. Prency had occasion\n",
      "to leave the room for an instant soon after, and Jane lifted her head\n",
      "and said,--\n",
      "\n",

      "herself, as she had said to her mother several days before, that Jane\n",

      "there were sometimes \"great larks,\" as the young men called them, at\n",
      "the village hotel, and she wondered how much the underlings of the\n",
      "establishment could know about them, and what stories they could tell.\n",
      "Jane suddenly became to her more interesting than she had yet been. She\n",
      "wondered what further questions to ask, and could not think of any that\n",
      "she could put into words. Finally, she left the room, sought her\n",
      "mother, and exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother, I'm not going to marry Reynolds Bartram. If hotel servants\n",
      "know all about his goings-on evenings, what stories may they not tell\n",

      "I don't suppose they know the difference between the truth and a lie;\n",
      "at least they never do when we hire them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The mother looked at the daughter tenderly and shrewdly. Then she\n",
      "smiled, and said,--\n",

      "As the special meetings at the church went on, Deacon Quickset began to\n",
      "fear that he had made a mistake. He had taken an active part in all\n",
      "previous meetings of the same kind for more than twenty-five years. The\n",
      "results of some of them had been very satisfactory, and the deacon\n",
      "modestly but nevertheless with much self-gratulation had recounted his\n",
      "own services in all of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoso converteth a sinner from the error of his ways shall save a soul\n",
      "from death and cover a multitude of sins; that is what the good book\n",
      "says,\" said the deacon to himself one day, as he walked from his house\n",
      "to his place of business; \"and considering the number of people that I\n",
      "have helped to snatch as brands from the burning, it does seem to me\n",
      "that I must have covered a good many sins of my own,--such as they are.\n",
      "I'm only a human being, and a poor, weak, and sinful creature, but\n",
      "there's certainly a good many folks in this town that would not have\n",
      "started in the right way when they did if it hadn't been for what I\n",
      "said to them. Now, here's the biggest movement of the kind going on\n",
      "that ever was known in this town, and I'm out of it. What for? Just\n",
      "because I don't agree with Sam Kimper. I mean, just because Sam Kimper\n",
      "don't agree with me. I don't suppose the thing would have come to\n",
      "anything, anyhow, if it hadn't been for that fool of a young lawyer\n",
      "setting his foot in it in the way he did. Everybody likes excitement,\n",
      "and it's a bigger thing for him to have gone into this protracted\n",
      "meeting than it would be for a circus to come to town with four new\n",
      "elephants. It's rough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The deacon took a few papers from his pocket, looked them over, his\n",
      "face changing from grave to puzzled and from puzzled to angry and back\n",
      "again through a whole gamut of facial expressions. Finally, he thrust\n",
      "the entire collection back into his pocket, and said to himself,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he keeps on at that work, I may have as much trouble as he let on\n",
      "that I would. I don't see how some of these things are going to be\n",
      "settled unless I have him to help me; and if he's going to be as\n",
      "particular as he makes out, or as he did make out the other day,\n",
      "there's going to be trouble, just as sure as both of us are alive. Of\n",
      "course, the more prominent he is before the public, the less he'll want\n",
      "to be in any case in court that takes hard fighting, particularly when\n",
      "he don't think he's on the popular side. And there's that Mrs. Poynter\n",
      "that's been bothering me to death about the interest on her mortgage: I\n",
      "keep hearing that she's at the meetings every night, and that she never\n",
      "lets an evening pass without speaking to Bartram. Maybe all she's\n",
      "talking about is some sinner or other that she wants to have saved; but\n",
      "if she acts with him as she does with me, I'm awfully afraid that she's\n",
      "consulting him about that interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think it was the right time of the year to start special\n",
      "meetings, anyhow; and I don't know what our minister did it for without\n",
      "consulting the deacons. He never did such a thing in his life before.\n",
      "It does seem to me that once in a while everything goes crosswise, and\n",
      "it all happens just when I need most of all to have things go along\n",
      "straight and smooth. Gracious! if some of these papers in my pocket\n",

      "The deacon had almost reached the business street as this soliloquy\n",
      "went on, but he seemed inclined to carry on his conversation with\n",
      "himself: so he deliberately turned about and slowly paced the way\n",
      "backward towards his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said he, after a few moments of silence, in\n",

      "the best way out, after all. I do believe I'll do it. Yes, I will do\n",
      "it. I'll go and buy out that shoe-shop of Larry Highgetty's, and I'll\n",
      "let Sam Kimper have it at just what it costs, and trust him for all the\n",
      "purchase-money. I don't believe the good-will of the place and all the\n",
      "stock that is in it will cost over a couple of hundred dollars; and\n",
      "Larry would take my note at six months almost as quick as he'd take\n",
      "anybody else's money. If things go right I can pay the note, and if\n",
      "they don't he can get the property back. But in the meantime folks\n",
      "won't be able to say anything against me. They can't say then that I'm\n",
      "down on Sam, like some of them say now, and if anybody talks about\n",
      "Bartram and the upper-crust folks that have been helping the meetings\n",
      "along, I can just remind them that talk is cheap and that it's money\n",
      "that tells. I'll do it, as sure as my name's Quickset; and the quicker\n",
      "I do it the better it will be for me, if I'm not mistaken.\"\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, Sam,\" said the deacon, trying to be pleasant, though his mouth\n",
      "was very severely set, \"while you're in the converting line,--which I\n",
      "hear you're doing wonders at, and I'm very glad to hear it,--why don't\n",
      "you begin at home and bring about a change in Larry?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "and I'm goin' to see that priest of his about--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Sam!\" groaned the deacon. \"The idea of going to see a Catholic\n",
      "priest about a fellow-man's salvation, when there's a special meeting\n",
      "running in our own church and you've taken such an interest in it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every man for his own, deacon,\" said Sam. \"I don't believe Larry cares\n",
      "anythin' about the church that you belong to, an' that I've been goin'\n",
      "to for some little time, an' I know he thinks a good deal of Father\n",
      "Black. I've found out myself, after a good deal of trouble in this\n",
      "world, that it makes a good deal of difference who talks to you about\n",
      "such things. Now, he thinks Father Black is the best man there is in\n",
      "the world. I don't know anythin' about that, though I don't know of\n",
      "anybody in this town I ever talked to that left me feelin' more\n",
      "comfortable an' looked more like a good man himself than that old\n",
      "priest did one day when he come in here an' talked to me very kindly.\n",
      "Why, deacon, he didn't put on any airs at all. He talked just as if he\n",
      "was a good brother of mine, an' he left me feelin' that if I wasn't\n",
      "good I was a brother of his anyhow. That's more than I can say most\n",
      "other folks in this town ever did, deacon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The deacon was so horrified at this unexpected turn of the conversation\n",
      "that for a little while he entirely forgot the purpose for which he had\n",
      "come. But he was recalled to his senses by the entrance of Reynolds\n",
      "Bartram. His eyes met the lawyer's, and at once the deacon looked\n",
      "defiant. Then he pulled himself together, and, with a mighty effort,\n",
      "remarked,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sam, some folks say I am down on you, and that I don't sympathize with\n",
      "you. Some folks talk a good deal for you, and to you, and don't do\n",
      "anything for you. But I just came in this morning for the sole purpose\n",
      "of saying this: You've had a hard row to hoe, and you've worked at it\n",
      "first rate ever since you got out of jail. I've been watching you,\n",
      "though perhaps you don't know it, and I came here to say that I believe\n",
      "so much in your having had a change--though I do insist you haven't\n",
      "gone far enough--I came around to say that I was going to buy out this\n",
      "place from Larry, and give it to you at your own terms, so that you can\n",
      "make all the money that comes in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam looked up in astonishment at the lawyer. The lawyer looked down\n",
      "smilingly at the deacon, who was seated on a very low bench, and\n",
      "said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deacon, we're all a good, deal alike in this world in one respect: our\n",
      "best thoughts come too late. I don't hesitate to say that some good\n",
      "thoughts, which I have heard you urge upon other people but which you\n",
      "never mentioned to me, have come to me a deal later than they should.\n",
      "But, on the other hand, this matter of making Sam the master of this\n",
      "shop has already been attended to. I've bought it for him myself, and\n",
      "made him a free and clear present of it last night in token of the\n",
      "immense amount of good which he has done me by personal example.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul!\" exclaimed the deacon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind saying,\" continued the lawyer, \"that if _you_ will go to\n",
      "work and do me half as much good, I will buy just as much property and\n",
      "make you a free and clear present of it. I am open to all possible\n",
      "benefits of that kind nowadays, and willing to pay for them, so far as\n",
      "money will go, to the full extent of my income and capital.\" The deacon\n",
      "arose and looked about him in a dazed sort of fashion. Then he looked\n",
      "at the lawyer inquiringly, put his hand in his pocket, drew forth a\n",
      "mass of business papers, shuffled them over once more, looked again at\n",
      "the lawyer, and said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Bartram, I've got some particular business with you that I would\n",
      "like to talk about at once. Would you mind coming to my office, or\n",
      "taking me around to yours?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all. Good luck, Sam,\" said the lawyer. \"Good day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two men went out together. No sooner were they outside the shop\n",
      "than the deacon said, rapidly,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Reynolds Bartram, my business affairs are in the worst possible\n",
      "condition. You know more about them than anybody else. You have done as\n",
      "much as anybody else to put them in the muddle that they're in now. You\n",
      "helped me into them, and now, church or no church, religion or no\n",
      "religion, you've got to help me out of them, or I've got to go to the\n",
      "devil. Now, what are you going to do about it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it as bad as that?\" murmured the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's as bad as that, and I could put it a good deal stronger if\n",
      "it was necessary. Everything has been going wrong. That walnut timber\n",
      "tract over on the creek, that I expected to get about five thousand\n",
      "dollars out of, isn't worth five thousand cents. Since the last time I\n",
      "was over there some rascal stole every log that was worth taking, and\n",
      "the place wouldn't bring under the hammer half what I gave for it. I\n",
      "have been trying to sell it, but somehow everybody that wanted it\n",
      "before has found out what has been going on. This is an awfully mean\n",
      "world on business-men that don't look out for themselves all the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not think you had ever any right to complain of it, deacon,\"\n",
      "said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, now,\" said the deacon, \"I'm not in any condition to be\n",
      "tormented to-day, Reynolds,--I really ain't. I'm almost crazy. I\n",
      "suppose old Mrs. Poynter has been at you to get her interest-money out\n",
      "of me, hasn't she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hasn't spoken a word to me about it,\" said the lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I heard she was after you every night in the meeting--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She was after me, talking about one sinner or another of her\n",
      "acquaintance, but she didn't mention you, deacon. It's a sad mistake,\n",
      "perhaps, but in a big town like this a person can't think of everybody\n",
      "at once, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, Bartram, shut up, and tell me what I have to do.\n",
      "Time is passing. I must have a lot of ready cash to-day, somehow, and\n",
      "here are all these securities; the minute I try to sell them people go\n",
      "to asking questions, and you're the only man they can come to. Now,\n",
      "you know perfectly well what the arrangements and understandings were\n",
      "when these papers were drawn, because you drew them all yourself. Now,\n",
      "if people come to you I want you to promise me that you're not going to\n",
      "go back on me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The deacon still held the papers in his hand, gesticulating with them.\n",
      "As he spoke, the lawyer took them, looked at them, and finally said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Deacon, how much money do you need?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't get through,\" said the deacon, \"with less than nine hundred\n",
      "dollars ready cash, or first-class checks and notes, this very day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Humph!\" said the lawyer, still handling the papers. \"Deacon, I'll make\n",
      "you a straightforward proposition concerning that money. If you will\n",
      "agree that I shall be agent of both parties in any settlement of these\n",
      "agreements which I hold in my hand, and that you will accept me as sole\n",
      "and final arbitrator in any differences of opinion between you and the\n",
      "signers, I will agree personally to lend you the amount you need, on\n",
      "your simple note of hand, renewable from time to time until you are\n",
      "ready to pay it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ray Bartram,\" exclaimed the deacon, stopping short and looking the\n",
      "lawyer full in the face, \"what on earth has got into you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Religion, I guess, deacon,\" said the lawyer. \"Try it yourself: it'll\n",
      "do you good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer walked off briskly, and left the deacon standing alone in\n",
      "the street. As the deacon afterwards explained the matter to his wife,\n",

      "\n",
      "Tom wanted to go somewhere else; what boy doesn't, when his parents\n",

      "I'm doin' a lot o' good in town. Once in a while, though, somebody\n",
      "laughs at me,--laughs at somethin' I say. It's been hurtin' me, an' I\n",
      "told Judge Prency so the other day; but he said, 'Sam, it isn't what\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did you, though?\" asked Tom, with some inflections that caused the\n",
      "cobbler to look up in time to see that his son was looking at him\n",
      "admiringly; there could be no doubt about it. Sam had never been looked\n",
      "at that way before by his big boy, and the consequence was an entirely\n",
      "new and pleasurable sensation. After thinking it over a moment, he\n",
      "replied,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I did, an' any fun that was to be found I looked after in them\n",

      "for the trouble; but things was as they was. Now I wish I'd done\n",
      "diff'rent; but it's too late to get back what I missed by dodgin'\n",
      "lessons. Tom, if I could talk better, it would be a good thing for me;\n",
      "but I ain't got no time to go to school. You've been to school a lot:\n",
      "why can't you come to the shop with me, an' sit down an' tell me where\n",
      "an' how I don't talk like other folks?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom indulged in a long and convulsive chuckle.\n",

      "Tom did not answer; he sulked a little while, but finally entered the\n",

      "most persistently urged upon her pupils,--that they should not drop\n",
      "letters from the ends of words, nor say \"ain't\" or \"hain't.\" Then Sam\n",

      "fairly into his story. \"Your father ain't goin' to be laughed at in his\n",
      "own house, by his own family, while I'm around to stand up for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stuff!\" exclaimed Tom, in amazement. Then he laughed as he\n",
      "reverted to his father's efforts at correct pronunciation, and\n",
      "continued his story. Suddenly he was startled by seeing his mother\n",
      "snatch a stump of a fire-shovel from the hearth and brandish it over\n",
      "his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You give up that talk right away!\" exclaimed the woman. \"Your father\n",

      "an' livin'. He's the best man in this town; I don't care if he _has_\n",
      "been in the penitentiary, I'm not goin' to hear a bit of fun made of\n",
      "him, not even by one of his own young ones.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All the brute in Tom's nature came to the surface in an instant, yet\n",
      "his amazement kept him silent and staring. It was such a slight,\n",
      "feeble, contemptible figure, that of the woman who was threatening to\n",
      "punish him,--him, Tom Kimper, whom few men in town would care to meet\n",
      "in a trial of strength. It set Tom to thinking; he said afterwards the\n",
      "spectacle was enough to make a brickbat wake up and think. At last he\n",
      "exclaimed, tenderly,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You never said it that way before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was so astonished by what he saw and heard that he shuffled up to\n",
      "his mother and awkwardly placed his clumsy hand upon her cheek. In an\n",
      "instant his mother's arms were around his neck so tight that Tom feared\n",
      "he was being strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Tom, Tom! what's got into me? What's got into both of us?\n",
      "Ev'rythin's diff'rent to what it used to be. It's carryin' me right off\n",
      "my feet sometimes. I don't know how to stand it all, an' yet I\n",
      "wouldn't have it no other way for nothin'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom could not explain, but he did something a great deal better; for\n",
      "the first time since he ceased being a baby and his mother began to\n",
      "tire of him, he acted affectionately to the woman who was leaning upon\n",
      "him. He put his strong arm around her, and repeated the single word\n",
      "\"Mother\" often and earnestly. As for Mrs. Kimper, no further\n",
      "explanation seemed necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "After mother and son had become entirely in accord, through methods\n",
      "which only Heaven and mothers understand, Mrs. Kimper began to make\n",
      "preparations for the family's mid-day meal. While she worked, her\n",
      "daughter Jane appeared, and threw cold water upon a warm affectional\n",
      "glow by announcing,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm fired.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean, child?\" asked her mother.\n",
      "\n",

      "workin' there, an' he's been awful polite to me. He never used to be\n",
      "that way when him an' the other young fellers in town used to come down\n",
      "to the hotel an' drink in the big room behind the saloon. Miss Prency\n",
      "got to askin' me questions about him this morning, an' the less I told\n",

      "\n",

      "that she was unable to answer, or to remember that she already had\n",

      "worked, her husband came in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wife,\" said Sam, \"everything seems turning upside down. Deacon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you go talk to the preacher or Ray Bartram?\" asked Mrs.\n",
      "Kimper, after the natural expressions of astonishment had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Sam, \"I suppose it was because I wanted to talk to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You're my wife; that's much--to me. Some day I hope it will be the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a knock at the door, and as soon as Sam shouted \"Come in!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sam,\" said he, \"ever since I saw you were in earnest about living a\n",
      "new life, I've been trying to arrange matters so that your boy Joe--I\n",
      "suppose you know why he ran away--could come back without getting into\n",
      "trouble. It was not easy, for the man from whom he--took something\n",
      "seemed to feel very ugly. But he has promised not to prosecute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank God!\" exclaimed Sam. \"If now I knew where the boy was--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've attended to that, too. I've had him looked up and found and\n",
      "placed in good hands for two or three weeks, and I don't believe you\n",
      "will be ashamed of him when he returns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Kimper lapsed into silence, and the judge felt uncomfortable. At\n",
      "last Sam exclaimed,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel as if it would take a big prayer and thanksgiving meeting to\n",
      "tell all that's in my mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A very good idea,\" said the judge; \"and, as you have the very people\n",
      "present who should take part in it, I will make haste to remove all\n",
      "outside influence.\" So saying, the judge bowed in his most courtly\n",

      "\n",
      "Eleanor Prency was a miserable young woman during most of the great\n",
      "revival season which followed the special meetings at Dr. Guide's\n",
      "church. She did not see Ray Bartram as much as of old, for the young\n",
      "man spent most of his evenings at the church, assisting in the work. He\n",
      "sang no wild hymns, nor did he make any ecstatic speeches; nevertheless\n",
      "his influence was great among his old acquaintances and upon the young\n",
      "men of the town. To \"stand up for prayers\" was to the latter class the\n",
      "supreme indication of courage or conviction; and any of them would have\n",
      "preferred to face death itself, at the muzzle of a gun, to taking such\n",
      "a step. But that was not all; Bartram had for some years been the\n",
      "leader of the unbelievers in the town; the logic of a young man who was\n",
      "smart enough to convince judges on the bench in matters of law was good\n",
      "enough for the general crowd when it was brought to bear upon religion.\n",
      "As one lounger at Weitz's saloon expressed himself,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None of the preachers or deacons or class-leaders was ever able to\n",
      "down that young feller before, but now he's just the same as gone and\n",
      "hollered 'enough.' It's no use for the rest of us to put on airs after\n",
      "that; nobody'll believe us, and like as not he'll be the first man to\n",
      "tell us what fools we be. I'm thinkin' a good deal of risin' for\n",
      "prayers myself, if it's only to get through before he gives me a\n",
      "talkin' to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When, however, the entire membership of the church aroused to the fact\n",
      "that work was to be done, and Judge Prency and other solid citizens\n",
      "began to take part in the church work, Bartram rested from his efforts\n",
      "and began again to spend his evenings at the home of the young woman\n",
      "whom he most admired. A change seemed to have come over others as well\n",
      "as himself. Mrs. Prency greeted him more kindly than ever, but Eleanor\n",
      "seemed different. She was not as merry, as defiant, or as sympathetic\n",
      "as of old. Sometimes there was a suggestion of old times in her manner,\n",
      "but suddenly the young woman would again become reserved and distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, when she had begun to rally him about something, and\n",
      "quickly lapsed into a different and languid manner, Bartram said,--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eleanor, nothing seems as it used to be between you and me. I wish I\n",
      "knew what was wrong in me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl suddenly interested herself in the contents of an antiquated\n",
      "photograph album.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must have become dreadfully uninteresting,\" he continued, \"if you\n",
      "prefer the faces in that album, of which I've heard you make fun time\n",
      "and again. Won't you tell me what it is? Don't be afraid to talk\n",
      "plainly: I can stand anything--from you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nothing,\" said Eleanor, continuing to pretend interest in the\n",
      "pictures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Nothing' said in that tone always means something--and a great deal\n",
      "of it. Have I said or done anything to offend you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Eleanor, with a sigh, closing the book and folding her\n",
      "hands, \"only--I didn't suppose you ever could become a prosy, poky old\n",
      "church-member.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The reply was a laugh, so merry, hearty, and long that Eleanor looked\n",
      "indignant, until she saw a roguish twinkle in Bartram's eyes; then she\n",
      "blushed and looked confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please tell me what I have said or done that was poky or prosy,\" asked\n",
      "Bartram. \"We lawyers have a habit of asking for proof as well as\n",
      "charges. I give you my word, my dear girl, that never in all my\n",
      "previous life did I feel so entirely cheerful and good-natured as I do\n",
      "nowadays. I have nothing now to trouble my conscience, or spoil my\n",
      "temper, or put me out of my own control, as used frequently to happen.\n",
      "I never before knew how sweet and delightful it was to live and meet my\n",
      "fellow-beings,--particularly those I love. I can laugh at the slightest\n",
      "provocation now, instead of sometimes feeling ugly and saying sharp\n",
      "things. Every good and pleasant thing in life I enjoy more than ever;\n",
      "and as you, personally, are the very best thing in life, you seem a\n",
      "thousand times dearer and sweeter to me than ever before. Perhaps you\n",
      "will laugh at me for saying so, but do you know that I, who have\n",
      "heretofore considered myself a little better than any one else in the\n",
      "village, am now organizing a new base-ball club and a gymnasium\n",
      "association, and also am trying to get enough subscribers to build a\n",
      "toboggan slide? I never was in such high spirits and in such humor for\n",
      "fun.\"\n",

      "\"Indeed! Where have your blessed eyes been? Hasn't your own father been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"About father? Certainly; but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'About father?' More hypocrisy. You know very well what I mean. Dear\n",
      "little girl, listen to me. I suppose there are people scared into\n",
      "religion through fear of the wrath to come, who may become dull and\n",
      "uninteresting. It is a matter of nature, in a great many cases. I\n",
      "suppose whatever is done for selfish reasons, even in the religious\n",
      "life, may make people uncertain and fearful, and sometimes miserable.\n",
      "But when a man suddenly determines to model his life after that of the\n",
      "one and only perfect man and gentleman the world ever knew, he does not\n",
      "find anything to make him dull and wretched. We hear so much of Jesus\n",

      "also He whose whole recorded life was in conformity with the tastes and\n",
      "sympathies of people of His day. Do you imagine for an instant that if\n",
      "He had been of solemn, doleful visage, any woman would ever have\n",
      "pressed through a crowd to touch the hem of His garment, that she might\n",
      "be made well? Do you suppose the woman of Samaria would have lingered\n",
      "one instant at the well of Jacob, had Jesus been a man with a face\n",
      "like--well, suppose I say Deacon Quickset? Do you think mothers would\n",
      "have brought their children to Him that He might bless them? Do you\n",
      "imagine any one who had not a great, warm heart could have wept at the\n",
      "grave of his friend Lazarus, whom He knew He had the power to raise\n",
      "from the dead? Didn't He go to the marriage jollification at Cana, and\n",
      "take so much interest in the affair that He made up for the deficiency\n",
      "in the host's wine-cellar? Weren't all His parables about matters that\n",
      "showed a sympathetic interest in the affairs which were nearest to the\n",

      "one who had His inner heart full of tremendous responsibilities, what\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The revival into which were merged the special meetings at Dr. Guide's\n",
      "church continued so long that religion became absolutely and\n",
      "enthrallingly fashionable in Bruceton. Many drinking men ceased to\n",
      "frequent the bar-room of the town, some old family feuds came to an\n",
      "end, and several couples who should have been married long before were\n",
      "joined in the holy bonds of wedlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the oldest inhabitants agreed that never before had life\n",
      "in Bruceton been so pleasant. Everybody was on good terms with\n",
      "everybody else, and no one, no matter how poor or common, lacked\n",
      "pleasant greetings on the street from acquaintances of high degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been some wonderful conversions during the meetings;\n",
      "hard-swearing, hard-drinking men had abandoned their evil ways, and\n",
      "were apparently as willing and anxious as any one else to be informed\n",
      "as to how to conform their lives to the professions which they had\n",
      "made. All the other churches sympathized with the efforts which Dr.\n",
      "Guide's flock had been making, for they themselves had been affected to\n",
      "their visible benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Guide himself became one of the humblest of the humble. Always a\n",
      "man of irreproachable life and warm heart, it never had occurred to him\n",
      "that anything could be lacking in his church methods. But he also was a\n",
      "man of quick perceptions: so, as the meetings went on, and he realized\n",
      "that their impetus was due not at all to anything he had said or done,\n",
      "but solely to the personal example of Sam Kimper, he fell into deep\n",
      "thought and retrospection. He resolutely waived all compliments which\n",
      "his clerical brethren of other denominations offered him on what they\n",
      "were pleased to call the results of his ministrations, and honestly\n",
      "insisted that the good work was begun by the example set by Sam Kimper,\n",
      "the ex-convict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Guide was an honest believer in the \"church universal,\" but he had\n",
      "been trained to regard the Church of Rome as the \"scarlet woman\" of\n",
      "Revelation, and whenever he met Father Black in the streets he\n",
      "recognized him only with a dignified bow. The day before the closing\n",
      "meeting, however, he encountered the priest at the turning of a\n",
      "corner,--too suddenly for a change of manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear brother!\" exclaimed Father Black, extending both hands and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"My dear sir,\" said the pastor, rallying all his powers to withstand\n",

      "as good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I help it?\" said the priest, impetuously. \"The spirit which\n",
      "your church efforts have awakened has spread throughout the town and\n",
      "affected everybody. There are men--and some women--of my flock whom\n",
      "I've been trying in vain for years to bring to confession, so as to\n",
      "start them on a new life. I've coaxed them, threatened them, prayed for\n",
      "them with tears of agony, for what soul is not dear to our Saviour? The\n",
      "worse the soul, the more the Saviour yearns to reclaim it. You remember\n",
      "the parable of the ninety-and-nine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who can forget it?\" said the reverend doctor, tears springing to his\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No one, my dear brother,--no one,\" replied the priest. \"Well, my lost\n",
      "sheep have all come back. The invisible Church has helped the visible,\n",
      "and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is my Church, then, invisible?\" asked Dr. Guide, with a quick relapse\n",
      "into his old-time manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My dear brother,\" exclaimed the priest, \"which is the greater? Which\n",

      "the chief priests and elders, who were the types of the clergymen and\n",
      "formal religious people of our day, questioned Him about His works and\n",
      "His authority. They had a mass of tradition and doctrine by which they\n",
      "were justified in their own eyes, and the presence, the works, the\n",
      "teachings and the daily life of Jesus were a thorn in their flesh. It\n",
      "annoyed them so that they crucified Him in order to be rid of His purer\n",
      "influence. We, who know more of Him than they, have been continually\n",
      "crucifying our Lord afresh by paying too much attention to the letter\n",
      "and ignoring the spirit. 'These things should ye have done, and not\n",
      "left the others undone.' I say these words not by way of blame, but of\n",
      "warning. Heaven forbid that I ever shall need to repeat them!\"\n",

      "to-night; and, for fear that some one mayn't know it, I arise to own up\n",
      "to it myself. Nobody's stood up for the letter of the law and the plan\n",
      "of salvation stronger than I, and nobody has taken more pains to dodge\n",
      "the spirit of it. The scales have fallen from my eyes lately, but I\n",
      "suppose all of you have been seeing me as I am for a long, long time,\n",
      "and you've known me for the hypocrite that I now can see I've always\n",
      "been. I've done a good many things that I oughtn't to have done. I've\n",
      "told half-truths that were worse than lies. I've 'devoured widows'\n",
      "houses, and for a pretence made long prayers,' as the gospel says. But\n",
      "the worst thing I've done, and the thing I feel most sinful about, is\n",
      "that when an unfortunate fellow-citizen of ours came back to this town\n",
      "and tried to live a right life I did all I could to discourage him and\n",
      "make him just like myself. I want right here, encompassed about by a\n",
      "mighty cloud of witnesses, to confess that I've done that man an awful\n",
      "wrong, and I'm sorry for it. I've prayed to God to forgive me; but I'm\n",
      "not going to stop at that. Right here before you all I want to ask that\n",
      "man himself to forgive me, as I've asked him in private. I'm not going\n",
      "to stop at that, either. That man's life has opened my eyes, in spite\n",
      "of myself, to all the faults of my own; and I want to show my sincerity\n",
      "by promising, before you all, that I am that man's brother from this\n",

      "however he wants it.\"\n",

      "This book is not offered to the public as a finished romance, or even\n",

      "only not those who inspire pretty stories, but they are so literally\n",
      "the representatives of individuals who have lived that they cannot\n",
      "well be separated from their natural surroundings. It has seemed\n",
      "to the author that if American people could behold some of the\n",
      "men who have astonished themselves and others by their success as\n",
      "reformers, individual effort would not be so rare in communities where\n",
      "organization is not so easily effected, and where unfortunates are\n",
      "ruined in the midst of their neighbors, while organization is being\n",
      "hoped for. It is more than possible, too, that the accepted business\n",
      "principle that the pocket is the source of power, is not as clearly\n",
      "recognized as it should be in reform movements, and that the struggles\n",

      "without much stimulus from without, while it need not be feared that in\n",

      "Long and loud rang all the church bells of Barton on a certain summer\n",
      "evening twenty years ago. It was not a Sunday evening, for during\n",
      "an accidental lull there was heard, afar off yet distinctly, the\n",
      "unsanctified notes of the mail-carrier’s horn. And yet the doors of\n",
      "the village stores, which usually stood invitingly open until far into\n",
      "the night, were now tightly closed, while the patrons of the several\n",
      "drinking-shops of Barton congregated quietly within the walls of their\n",
      "respective sources of inspiration, instead of forming, as was their\n",
      "usual wont, lively groups on the sidewalk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, Barton was about to indulge in a monster temperance\n",
      "meeting. The “Sons of Temperance,” as well as the “Daughters” and\n",
      "“Cadets” thereof, the “Washingtonians,” the “Total Abstinence Society,”\n",
      "and all various religious bodies in the village had joined their forces\n",
      "for a grand demonstration against King Alcohol. The meeting had been\n",
      "appropriately announced, for several successive Sundays, from each\n",
      "pulpit in Barton; the two school-teachers of Barton had repeatedly\n",
      "informed their pupils of the time and object of the meeting; the\n",
      "“Barton Register” had devoted two leaders and at least a dozen items\n",
      "to the subject; and a poster, in the largest type and reddest ink\n",
      "which the “Register” office could supply, confronted one at every\n",
      "fork and crossing of roads leading to and from Barton, and informed\n",
      "every passer-by that Major Ben Bailey, the well-known champion of the\n",
      "temperance cause, would address the meeting, that the “Crystal Spring\n",
      "Glee Club” would sing a number of stirring songs, and that the Barton\n",
      "Brass Band had also been secured for the evening. The only inducement\n",
      "which might have been lacking was found at the foot of the poster, in\n",
      "the two words, “Admittance Free.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder the villagers crowded to the Methodist Church, the most\n",
      "commodious gathering-place in the town. Long before the bells had\n",
      "ceased clanging the church was so full that children occupying full\n",
      "seats were accommodatingly taken on the laps of their parents, larger\n",
      "children were lifted to the window-sills, deaf people were removed from\n",
      "the pews to the altar steps, and chairs were brought from the various\n",
      "residences and placed in the aisles. Outside the church, crowds stood\n",
      "about near the windows, while more prudent persons made seats of logs\n",
      "from the woodpile which the country members of the congregation had\n",
      "already commenced to form against the approaching winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden hush of the whispering multitude ushered in the clergy of\n",
      "Barton, and, for once, the four reverend gentlemen really seemed\n",
      "desirous of uniting against a common enemy instead of indulging in\n",
      "their customary quadrangular duel. Then, amid a general clapping of\n",
      "hands, the members of the Crystal Spring Glee Club filed in and took\n",
      "reserved seats at the right of the altar; while the Barton Brass Band,\n",
      "announced by a general shriek of “Oh!” from all the children present,\n",
      "seated themselves on a raised platform on the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Squire Tomple, the richest and fattest citizen of the town, was\n",
      "elected chairman, and accepted with a benignant smile. Then the\n",
      "Reverend Timotheus Brown, the oldest pastor in the village, prayed\n",
      "earnestly that intemperance might cease to reign. Squire Tomple then\n",
      "called on the band for some instrumental music, which was promptly\n",
      "given and loudly applauded, after which the Crystal Spring Glee Club\n",
      "sang a song with a rousing chorus. Then there was a touching dialogue\n",
      "between a pretended drunkard and his mother, in which the graceless\n",
      "youth was brought to a knowledge of the error of his ways, and moved\n",
      "to make a very full and grammatical confession. Then the band played\n",
      "another air, and the Glee Club sang “Don’t you go, Tommy,” and\n",
      "there was a tableau entitled “The First Glass,” and another of “The\n",
      "Drunkard’s Home,” after which the band played still another air. Then a\n",
      "member of the Executive Committee stepped on tiptoe up to the chairman\n",
      "and whispered to him, and the chairman assumed an air of dignified\n",
      "surprise, edged expectantly to one side of his chair, and finally arose\n",
      "suddenly as another member of the Executive Committee entered the rear\n",
      "door arm-in-arm with the great Major Ben Bailey himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The committee-man introduced the Major to the chairman, who in turn\n",
      "made the Major acquainted with the reverend clergy; the audience\n",
      "indulged in a number of critical and approving glances and whispers,\n",
      "and then the chair announced that the speaker of the evening would now\n",
      "instruct and entertain those there present. The speaker of the evening\n",
      "cleared his throat, took a swallow of water, threw his head back,\n",
      "thrust one hand beneath his coat-tails, and opened his discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was certainly a very able speaker. He explained in a few words the\n",
      "nature of alcohol, and what were its unvarying effects upon the human\n",
      "system; proved to the satisfaction and horror of the audience, from\n",
      "reports of analyses and from liquor-dealers’ handbooks, that most\n",
      "liquors were adulterated, and with impure and dangerous materials;\n",
      "explained how the use of beer and light wines created a taste for\n",
      "stronger liquors; showed the fallacy of the idea that liquor was in\n",
      "any sense nutritious; told a number of amusing stories about men who\n",
      "had been drunk; displayed figures showing how many pounds of bread and\n",
      "meat might be bought with the money spent in the United States for\n",
      "liquor, how many comfortable homes the same money would build, how many\n",
      "suits of clothing it would pay for, how many churches it would erect,\n",
      "and how soon it would pay the National Debt (which in those days was\n",
      "foolishly considered large enough to be talked about). Then, after\n",
      "drawing a touching picture of the drunkard’s home, and dramatically\n",
      "describing the horrors of the drunkard’s death, the gallant Major made\n",
      "an eloquent appeal to all present to forsake forever the poisonous\n",
      "bowl, and dropped into his seat amid a perfect thunder of applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lecture had been a powerful one; it was evident that the speaker\n",
      "had formed a deep impression on the minds of his hearers, for when\n",
      "the pledge was circulated, men and women who never drank snatched it\n",
      "eagerly and appended their names, some parents even putting pencils\n",
      "into baby fingers, and with devout pride helping the little ones\n",
      "to trace their names. Nor were the faithful alone in earnestness,\n",
      "for a loud shout of “Bless the Lord!” from Father Baguss, who was\n",
      "circulating one of the pledges, attracted attention to the fact that\n",
      "the document was being signed by George Doughty, Squire Tomple’s own\n",
      "book-keeper, one of the most promising young men in Barton, except that\n",
      "he occasionally drank. Then the list of names taken in the gallery was\n",
      "read, and it was ascertained that Tom Adams, who drove the brick-yard\n",
      "wagon, and whose sprees were mighty in length and magnitude, had also\n",
      "signed. Half a dozen men hurried into the gallery to congratulate\n",
      "Tom Adams, and so excited that gentleman that he took a pledge and a\n",
      "pencil, went into the crowd outside the church, and soon returned with\n",
      "the names of some of the heaviest drinkers in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excitement increased. Cool-headed men--men who rarely or never\n",
      "drank, yet disapproved of binding pledges--gave in their names almost\n",
      "before they knew it. Elder Hobbedowker moved a temporary suspension\n",
      "of the circulation of the pledges until the Lord could be devoutly\n",
      "thanked for this manifestation of his grace; then the good elder\n",
      "assumed that his motion had been put and carried, and he immediately\n",
      "made an earnest prayer. During the progress of the prayer the leader\n",
      "of the band--perhaps irreverently, but acting under the general\n",
      "excitement--brought his men to attention, and the elder’s “Amen” was\n",
      "drowned in the opening crash of a triumphal march. Then the Glee\n",
      "Club sang “Down with Rum,” but were brought to a sudden stop by the\n",
      "chairman, who excused himself by making the important announcement\n",
      "that their fellow-citizen, Mr. Crupp, who had been a large vender of\n",
      "intoxicating beverages, had declared his intention to abandon the\n",
      "business forever. The four pastors shook hands enthusiastically with\n",
      "each other; while, in response to deafening cheers, the heroic Crupp\n",
      "himself was thrust upon the platform, where, with a trembling voice\n",
      "and a pale though determined face, he reaffirmed his decision. Old\n",
      "Parson Fish hobbled to the front of the pulpit, straightened his bent\n",
      "back until his mien had at once some of the lamb and the lion about\n",
      "it, and, raising his right hand authoritatively, started the doxology,\n",
      "“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,” in which he was devoutly and\n",
      "uproariously joined by the whole assemblage. This done, the people,\n",
      "by force of habit, waited a moment as if expecting the benediction;\n",
      "then remembering it was not Sunday, they broke into a general and\n",
      "very enthusiastic chat, which ceased only when the sexton, who was a\n",
      "creature of regular habits, announced from the pulpit that the oil\n",
      "in the lamps would last only a few minutes longer, and that _he_ had\n",
      "promised to be at home by ten o’clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Squire Tomple took the arm of the penitent Crupp and appropriated him\n",
      "in full. There was a great deal to Squire Tomple besides avoirdupois,\n",
      "and when thoroughly aroused, his enthusiasm was of a magnitude\n",
      "consistent with his size. Besides, Squire Tomple was in the habit\n",
      "of having his own way, as became the richest man in Barton, and he\n",
      "appropriated Mr. Crupp as a matter of course. With Mr. Crupp on his\n",
      "arm and the great cause in his heart, he appeared to himself so fully\n",
      "the master of the situation that the foul fiend of drunkenness seemed\n",
      "conquered forever, and the Squire swung his cane with a triumphal\n",
      "violence which seriously threatened the safety of the villagers in\n",
      "front of and behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire held his peace while surrounded by the home-going crowd, as\n",
      "rightly became a great man; but when he had turned into the street in\n",
      "which Mr. Crupp lived, he said, with due condescension,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crupp, you’ve done the right thing; you _might_ have done it sooner,\n",
      "but you can do a great deal of good yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ex-rumseller quietly replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, if I’m helped at it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Helped? Of course you’ll be helped, if you pray for it. You’ve\n",
      "repented; now address the throne of grace, and----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I know,” interrupted Mr. Crupp. “I’m not entirely unacquainted\n",
      "with the Lord, if I _have_ sold rum. You know his sun shines on the\n",
      "just and the unjust, and I’ve had a good share of it. It’s help from\n",
      "men that I want, and am afraid that I can’t get it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Crupp,” remonstrated the Squire, “you must have made something\n",
      "out of your business, if it _is_ an infernal one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mean that,” replied Mr. Crupp, a little tartly. “You’ve been\n",
      "on your little drunks when you were young, of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire almost twitched Mr. Crupp off the sidewalk, as he exclaimed,\n",
      "with righteous indignation,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never was drunk in my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said the convert. “Well, some have, and pledges won’t quiet an\n",
      "uneasy stomach, no way you can fix ’em. Them that never drank are all\n",
      "right, but the drinking boys that signed to-night’ll be awful thirsty\n",
      "in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the Squire, “_they_ must pray, and act like men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some of ’em don’t believe in prayin’, and some of ’em can’t act like\n",
      "men, because ’tisn’t in ’em. There’s men that seem to need whisky as\n",
      "much as they need bread; leastways, they don’t seem able to do without\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I’d been you, and believed that, Crupp,” replied the Squire, with\n",
      "noticeable coolness and deliberation, “I wouldn’t have signed the\n",
      "pledge; that is, I wouldn’t have stopped selling liquor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“P’r’aps not,” returned the ex-rumseller; “but with me it’s different.\n",
      "There’s some men that b’lieves that sellin’ a woman a paper of pins,\n",
      "and measurin’ out a quart of tar for a farmer, is small business, an’\n",
      "beneath ’em, but they stick to it. Now I believe I’m too much of a man\n",
      "to sell whisky, so I’ve stopped.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire took the rebuke in silence; however much his face may\n",
      "have flushed, there were in Barton no tell-tale gas-lamps to make\n",
      "his discomfort visible. The Squire had grown rich as a vender of the\n",
      "thousand little things sold in country stores; he had many a time\n",
      "declared that storekeeping was a dog’s life, and that he, Squire\n",
      "Tomple, was everybody’s nigger--but he made no attempt to change his\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I mean,” continued Mr. Crupp, “by needin’ help, is this: I know\n",
      "just about how much every drinkin’ man in town takes, an’ when he takes\n",
      "it, an’ about when he gets on his sprees. Now, if there’s anybody to\n",

      "On the morning after the meeting the happiest man in all Barton\n",
      "was the Reverend Jonas Wedgewell. He had been one of the first to\n",
      "agitate the subject of a grand temperance demonstration; in fact, he\n",
      "had, while preaching the funeral sermon of a young man who had been\n",
      "drowned while drunk, prophesied that the sad event which had on that\n",
      "occasion drawn his hearers together would give a mighty impetus to the\n",
      "temperance movement; then like a sensible, matter-of-fact prophet, he\n",
      "exerted himself to the uttermost that his prophecy might be fulfilled.\n",
      "He subscribed liberally to the fund which paid for advertising the\n",
      "meeting; he labored personally a full hour with the performer on the\n",
      "big drum, and ended by persuading him to forego a coon-hunt on that\n",
      "particular night, that he might take part in a hunt for nobler game.\n",
      "The Reverend Jonas had drafted all the pledges which were circulated\n",
      "during the meeting, and had seen to it that they contained no weak\n",
      "or ungrammatic expressions which might tempt thirsty souls to treat\n",
      "disrespectfully the documents and the principles they embodied. He had\n",
      "reached the church door at the third tap of the bell, had greeted all\n",
      "his reverend brethren with a hearty shake with both his own hands, and\n",
      "had offered the Reverend Timotheus Brown so many pertinent suggestions\n",
      "as to the prayer which that gentleman had been requested to make that\n",
      "the ancient divine remarked, with a touch of saintly sarcasm, that he\n",
      "did not consider that the occasion justified him in making a departure\n",
      "from his habit of offering strictly original prayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the whole course of the meeting good Pastor Wedgewell sat\n",
      "expectantly on the extreme end of the pulpit sofa, his body inclined a\n",
      "little forward, his hands upon his knees, his eyes gleaming brightly\n",
      "through polished glasses, and his whole pose suggesting the most\n",
      "intense earnestness. He discerned a telling point before its verbal\n",
      "expression was fully completed, his hands commenced to applaud the\n",
      "moment the point was announced; his varnished boots and well-stored\n",
      "head beat time alike to “Lily Dale,” the march from “Norma,” “Sweet\n",
      "Spirit, hear my prayer,” and such other airs as the band was not\n",
      "ashamed to play in public; he sprang from his seat and approvingly\n",
      "patted the youthful backs of the pretended drunkard and his mother, he\n",
      "laughed almost hysterically at the wit of the lecturer, and moistened\n",
      "handkerchief after handkerchief as the able speaker depicted the sad\n",
      "results of drunkenness. While the pledges were being circulated, the\n",
      "reverend man occupied a position which raked the house, and he was the\n",
      "first to announce to the faithful in the front seats the capture of any\n",
      "drinking man. He intercepted Tom Lyker, a tin-shop apprentice, who had\n",
      "signed the pledge, in the aisle, immediately after the audience was\n",
      "dismissed, and suggested that they should together hold a season of\n",
      "prayer in the study attached to the church; and the rather curt manner\n",
      "in which the repentant but not altogether regenerate Thomas declined\n",
      "the invitation did not abash the holy man in the least; for, as the\n",
      "audience finally dispersed, he secured a few faithful ones, with whom\n",
      "he adjourned to the study, and enjoyed what he afterward referred to as\n",
      "a precious season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wedgewell, who rendered but feeble reverence unto him who was\n",
      "at once her spouse and her spiritual adviser, had been known to say\n",
      "that when the old gentleman was wound up there was no knowing when\n",
      "he would run down again; and all who saw the good man on the morning\n",
      "after the meeting, admitted that his wife’s simile was an uncommonly\n",
      "apt one. Squire Tomple believed so fully in the advantages of the\n",
      "early bird over all others in search of sustenance, that his store was\n",
      "always opened at sunrise; yet George Doughty had just taken the third\n",
      "shutter from the front window, when a gentle tap on the shoulder caused\n",
      "him to drop the rather heavy board upon his toes. As he wrathfully\n",
      "turned himself, he beheld the approving countenance and extended\n",
      "congratulatory hand of the Reverend Wedgewell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“George, my dear, my noble young friend,” said he, as the irate\n",
      "youth squeezed his agonized toes, “you have performed a most noble\n",
      "and meritorious action--an action which you will never have cause to\n",
      "regret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment or two the young man’s face said many things not seemly to\n",
      "express in appropriate words to a clergyman; but he finally recovered\n",
      "his sense of politeness, and replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope I shan’t repent of it, but I don’t know. It may be noble and\n",
      "meritorious to sign the pledge, but a fellow needs to have twenty times\n",
      "as much man in him to keep it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you don’t mean to say, George, that you’ll allow such a vile\n",
      "appetite to regain its ascendency over you?” pleaded the preacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_’Tisn’t_ a vile appetite,” quickly replied the young man. “I need\n",
      "whisky as much as I need bread and butter--yes, and a great deal more,\n",
      "too. I have to open the store at sunrise, and keep it open till nine\n",
      "o’clock and after, have to make myself agreeable to anywhere from two\n",
      "to twenty people at a time, sell all I can, watch people who will steal\n",
      "the minute your eye is off of them, not let anybody feel neglected, and\n",
      "see that I get cash from everybody who isn’t good pay. When there isn’t\n",
      "anybody here, I’ve got to keep the books, see that the stock don’t run\n",
      "down in spots, and stir up people that are slow pay. The only way I can\n",
      "do it all is by taking something to help me. I _hate_ whisky--I’m going\n",
      "to try to leave it alone; but I tell you, Dominie, it’s going to be one\n",
      "of the biggest fights you ever knew a young man to go into.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The reverend listener was as easily depressed as he was exalted, and\n",
      "Doughty’s short speech had the effect of greatly elongating the\n",
      "minister’s countenance. Yet he had a great deal of that pertinacity\n",
      "which is as necessary to soldiers of the cross as it is to those of the\n",
      "bayonet; so he began manfully to search his mind for some weapon or\n",
      "means of defense which the clerk could use. Suddenly his countenance\n",
      "brightened, his benevolent eyes enlarged behind his glasses, and he\n",
      "exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just the thing! My dear young friend, the hand of Providence is in\n",
      "this matter. Your worthy employer was the chairman of our meeting last\n",
      "night; certainly he will be glad to give you such assistance as shall\n",
      "lessen the amount of your labors. Here he comes now. Let _me_ manage\n",
      "this affair; I really ask it as a favor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m much obliged, but I think--confound it!” ejaculated the young\n",
      "man, as his companion hastened out of earshot and buttonholed Squire\n",
      "Tomple. Half smiling and half frowning Doughty retired from the door,\n",
      "but took up a new position, from which he could see the couple. To\n",
      "the eyes of the clerk, his employer seemed a rock in his unchanging\n",
      "pose, while the old preacher, rich in many a grace not peculiar to\n",
      "country storekeepers, yet utterly ignorant of business and such of\n",
      "its perversions as are called requirements, seemed a mere lamb--a\n",
      "fancy which was strengthened by the incessant gesturing and change\n",
      "of position in which he indulged when in conversation. The pair soon\n",
      "separated; the minister walked away, his step seeming not so exultant\n",
      "as when he approached the merchant; while the latter, appearing to his\n",
      "clerk to be broader, deeper, and more solid than ever, approached the\n",
      "store, lifted up his head, displayed the face he usually wore when he\n",
      "found he had made a bad debt, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“George, I wish you wouldn’t try to talk about business to ministers.\n",
      "Old Wedgewell has just pestered me nearly to death; says you complain\n",
      "of having too much to do, and that you have to drink to keep up. It’ll\n",
      "be just like him to tell somebody else, and a pretty story that’ll be\n",
      "to go around about the chairman of a temperance meeting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t mean to say anything to him,” replied the clerk; “but he\n",
      "made me drop a shutter on my toes, and I guess that loosened my tongue\n",
      "a little. I didn’t tell him anything but the truth, though, Squire. I\n",
      "signed the pledge, last night, hoping you’d help me through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What--what do you mean, George?” asked the merchant, in a tone which\n",
      "defined the word “conservative” more clearly than lexicographer ever\n",
      "did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t work so many hours a day without drinking sometimes,” replied\n",
      "the clerk. “What I ask of you is to take a boy. If I could come in a\n",
      "couple of hours later every morning--and there’s next to nothing done\n",
      "in the first two hours of the day--I could have a decent amount of\n",
      "rest, not have to hurry so much, and wouldn’t break down so often, and\n",
      "have to go to whisky to be helped up again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A boy would have to be paid,” remarked the Squire in the tone he\n",
      "habitually used when making a penitential speech in class-meeting; “and\n",
      "here’s summer-time coming; there isn’t much business done in summer,\n",
      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A boy won’t cost more than a dollar a week the first year,” replied\n",
      "the clerk, “and you’d make that out of the people who sometimes _have_\n",
      "to go somewhere else and trade on days when you’re not here and I’m\n",
      "too busy to wait on them. There _isn’t_ so much money made in summer;\n",
      "but women come to the store then a good deal more than they do in the\n",
      "winter, and they take up an awful amount of time. Besides, the store\n",
      "has to be opened about two hours earlier every morning than it does in\n",
      "winter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The merchant pinched his gloomy brow and reflected. Doughty looked at\n",
      "him without much hopefulness. The Squire’s heart might be all right,\n",
      "but his pocket-book was by far the more sensitive and controlling\n",
      "organ. At last the Squire said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if it’s for _your_ good that you want the boy, you ought to be\n",
      "willing to pay his salary. Besides----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, Squire Tomple,” interrupted Doughty; “’tisn’t for my good\n",
      "alone. ‘Accursed be he who putteth the bottle to his brother’s lips.’\n",
      "I’ve heard you quote that to more than one man right in this store.\n",
      "That’s what you’re doing to me if you keep on. You sell half as much\n",
      "again as any other storekeeper in town, and why? Because I am smart\n",
      "enough to hold custom. I haven’t cared to do anything else. I’ve given\n",
      "myself up to making and holding custom for you, and I took to whisky to\n",
      "keep me up to my work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, haven’t I paid you for all you’ve done?” demanded the proprietor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; but now I ask you to pay a little more. I’ve told you why; and\n",
      "now the case stands just here: which do you care for most, the price\n",
      "of a boy or the soul of your faithful clerk? _You_ say a man’s soul’s\n",
      "in danger if he drinks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ll tell you, George,” replied the Squire, “I’ll think about\n",

      "The first task to which the penitent Crupp devoted himself on the\n",
      "morning after the meeting was hardly that which his new admirers had\n",
      "supposed he would attempt. They imagined he would knock in the heads\n",
      "of his barrels, and allow the accursed contents to flood his cellar;\n",
      "but Crupp, on the contrary, closed out the entire lot, for cash, at the\n",
      "highest prices he could exact from dealers with whom he had lately been\n",
      "in competition. “’Twas a splendid lot of liquors,” said Crupp, in the\n",
      "course of an explanatory speech at the post-office, while every one was\n",
      "waiting for the opening of the regular daily mail; “and though I _do_\n",

      "“Ah, my valiant friend,” said the Rev. Jonas, hastily drawing a\n",
      "chair near Mr. Crupp, and shedding upon him the full effulgence of a\n",
      "countenance beaming with enthusiastic adoration; “the morning songs of\n",
      "the angels of God must have been sweeter this morning as they thought\n",
      "of your noble deed. You have cast off the shackles of a most accursed\n",
      "bondage. Doubtless you wish to fulfill all of the conditions of the\n",
      "liberty with which Christ hath made you free. The church----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, parson,” interrupted Mr. Crupp; “but I don’t want to join\n",
      "the church--not just now, anyhow. I----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wish to consecrate your ill-gotten gains to the service of the Lord,”\n",
      "broke in the good pastor; but Mr. Crupp frowned, then pouted, then\n",
      "compressed his lips tightly, and gave so sudden a twitch as to wrench\n",
      "one of the joints of the sacred chair, as he replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, sir, I don’t, for I haven’t any ill-gotten gains. I never sold\n",
      "anything but good liquor, and the price was always fair. I never sold\n",
      "any liquor to a drunken man, either. What I came to you for is this:\n",
      "I know who drinks, when they drink, what they take, and I know pretty\n",
      "well _why_ they drink. Some of them signed the pledge last night, and\n",
      "they’re going to have an awful hard job in keeping it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Prayer----” interrupted the minister, but the hard-headed Crupp\n",
      "quickly completed the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Prayer never cured a dyspeptic stomach, that I’ve heard of, and\n",
      "I don’t believe it’ll take away a man’s hunger for whisky. These\n",
      "fellows that’s been drinking, and have got anything to ’em, _can_ be\n",
      "kept from falling into the old ways again; but they’ve got to be\n",
      "handled carefully, and what I came to you for was to ask who was going\n",
      "to do the handling? You know who’s free-handed with money in your\n",
      "congregation, and free-handed men ought to be free-hearted. I’m going\n",
      "to Dominie Brown on the same errand, and to the other preachers, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Crupp’s speech consumed only a moment of time, but its effect\n",
      "upon the preacher was wonderful--and depressing. From being a mirror\n",
      "of irrepressible Christian exultation, Mr. Wedgewell’s face became as\n",
      "solemn as it ever was when he bemoaned from the pulpit the apathy of\n",
      "the elect. His eyes enlarged behind his glasses, and he stared for a\n",
      "moment in an abstracted manner at a dreadful chromo which hung upon\n",
      "his wall--a chromo at which no one in active possession of his mental\n",
      "faculties could possibly have looked so long. But the old pastor had a\n",
      "heart so great that even his theology had been unable to wall it in,\n",
      "and after a moment of inevitable despondency he realized that Crupp was\n",
      "intent upon doing good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Crupp,” said he, turning his head suddenly, and regaining a\n",
      "portion of his earlier expression of countenance, “I do not fully\n",
      "comprehend your intention, but I can see that it is good. May I ask\n",
      "what the people of God can do for these beings who have been under the\n",
      "dominion of alcohol?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it’s a long story,” replied the old bartender. “Among them that\n",
      "signed, there isn’t one in ten that ever drank, and of them that drank,\n",
      "half of ’em’ll take something before night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And break their solemn vow! Awful! awful!” ejaculated the minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Crupp, “_’tis_ awful; but, on the other hand, there’s\n",
      "some that’s in earnest. There’s Tom Adams, now--he that drives the\n",
      "brick-yard team. Tom’s a good, square, honest fellow, and he loves his\n",
      "family, but I don’t see how he’s going to stop drinking. He can’t work\n",
      "without it; leastways, he can’t work along the way he’s working now.\n",
      "Deacon Jones ought to give him easier work to do until he can bring\n",
      "himself around; but Deacon Jones won’t waste his money in that way,\n",
      "if he _is_ a member of your church. Then there’s old Bunley: there\n",
      "isn’t anything _to_ him. He’s been drinking and drinking and drinking\n",
      "this forty year, he says, and yet he was well brought up, and he can’t\n",
      "keep himself from going to church every Sunday. He’s got some children\n",
      "that ain’t grown yet, and if some of the storekeepers would only give\n",
      "him credit without ever expecting to see their money again, the old\n",
      "fellow wouldn’t get down-hearted so often, and maybe he could quit\n",
      "drinking. As far as taking care of his family goes, he isn’t good for\n",
      "much the way he is; he borrows from soft-hearted fellows who can’t\n",
      "afford to lose as well as the storekeepers can, and _maybe_ he steals\n",
      "sometimes--I don’t say he _does_, mind. At any rate, the biggest part\n",
      "of his support comes out of the public, and as the public can’t help\n",
      "itself, it ought to be sensible enough to try to make the old chap feel\n",
      "and act like a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless me!” exclaimed Mr. Wedgewell, who had through all Mr. Crupp’s\n",
      "delivery sat erect with his hands upon his knees, and his eyes and\n",
      "mouth wide open. “I assure you, my dear sir, that I never had an\n",
      "idea that the success of the temperance cause depended upon so many\n",
      "conditions, and I also beg to assure you”--here the Reverend Jonas\n",
      "hastily proffered his right hand--“that I appreciate and admire the\n",
      "spirit which has prompted you to examine this subject in so many of\n",
      "its bearings, and to endeavor to throw light upon it. But surely all\n",
      "the--the men who, as you express it, have been drinking--surely these\n",
      "cannot be constrained to continue by conditions similar to those which\n",
      "you have instanced? There must be some who, if only they exercise their\n",
      "will-power, will succeed in putting their vile enemy under their feet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Crupp, “there _are_ such. Lots of young fellows drink\n",
      "only because they think it’s smart, and because they haven’t got\n",
      "man enough in them to stop when they want to. They’re like a lot of\n",
      "wolves--plucky enough when they’re together, but a live rooster could\n",
      "scare one of them if he caught him alone. _I’m_ going to look out for\n",
      "_that_ crowd myself; they need somebody to preach to ’em wherever he\n",
      "can catch ’em, and I know where they hang out. But I’m not through\n",
      "with the other kind yet. There’s Fred Macdonald, he’s going to be the\n",
      "hardest man to manage in the whole lot. Good family, you know--got\n",
      "a judge for a father, and ambitious as the----ambitious as Napoleon\n",
      "Bonaparte. He’s in with all the steamboat fellows, and whisky is an\n",
      "angel alongside of some things they carry. They’ll ruin him, sure.\n",
      "Steamboating looks like something big to him, you know; it shows off\n",
      "better than country stores and saw-mills. It’s no use talkin’ to him;\n",
      "I’ve tried it once or twice, for I know the steamboat people of old;\n",
      "but he as good as told me to mind my own business. Now if some of the\n",
      "business men could get up something enterprising, and put Fred at the\n",
      "head of it, on condition that he wouldn’t drink any more, they might\n",
      "make money and save him from going to the--the bad. _I’ll_ put some\n",
      "money into the thing, for I believe in Fred. Of course he’ll have to\n",
      "be watched a little, for he may be too venturesome; but he can get\n",
      "more trade and get more work out of his men than any other man in this\n",
      "county.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Crupp,” said the minister, again taking the hand of the newly-made\n",
      "reformer, and laying his own left hand affectionately upon Mr. Crupp’s\n",
      "right elbow, “I cannot find words adequate to the expression of my\n",
      "admiration of your earnestness in this great moral movement. But I must\n",
      "confess that your treatment of the subject is one to which I am utterly\n",
      "unaccustomed. I have been wont to regard intemperance solely as an\n",
      "indication of an infirm will and a depraved appetite, but your theory\n",
      "seems plausible; indeed, I do not see that either of our respective\n",
      "standpoints need be wrong. But, with regard to the employment of the\n",
      "reformatory means you suggest, I am not a capable adviser. It might be\n",
      "well for you to consult some of our leading business men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s what I am going to do,” replied Crupp. “And I am going to see\n",
      "the doctors, too, and all the other ministers. What I want of _you_ is,\n",
      "to back me up; preach at these fellows that are well enough off to make\n",
      "themselves useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll do it!” replied the minister with emphasis. “A suitable text\n",
      "has already providentially entered my mind: ‘Am I my brother’s\n",
      "keeper?’ Three heads and application: _First_, demonstrate that every\n",
      "man _is_ his brother’s keeper; _second_, show how in the divine\n",
      "economy it is wise that this should be so; _third_, the example of\n",
      "Christ; _application_, our duty to the needy in our midst. Another\n",
      "text suggests itself: ‘We, then, that are strong ought to bear the\n",
      "infirmities of the weak.’ And yet another: ‘Give strong drink unto him\n",
      "that is ready to perish;’ argument to be that if the Inspired Word\n",
      "justifies such action as that implied by the text, and if alcohol is\n",
      "the demon we believe it to be, it is our duty to prevent, by any means\n",
      "in our power, people from reaching a condition in which such a terrible\n",
      "remedy must be used. I beg your pardon, my dear Mr. Crupp,” exclaimed\n",
      "the minister, springing excitedly from his chair; “but if you have any\n",
      "other calls to make, I will repair at once to my study and prepare a\n",
      "discourse based upon one of these texts. Excuse my seeming rudeness in\n",
      "thus abruptly closing our interview, but my soul is on fire--on fire\n",
      "with ardor which I cannot but believe is from heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” replied Mr. Crupp, rising quite briskly. “Business is\n",
      "business; it’s so in the liquor trade, I know, and I suppose it is in\n",
      "preaching. I’ll go down and see Squire Tomple, I guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rev. Jonas Wedgewell dropped abruptly into a chair, and the fire\n",
      "with which his soul had been consuming seemed suddenly to expire. His\n",
      "face became blank and expressionless, his lower jaw dropped a little,\n",
      "and he gasped,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Squire Tomple? I had a discouraging conversation with him only\n",
      "yesterday morning on a subject involving very nearly the ideas which\n",
      "you have advanced. His very estimable clerk, George Doughty, who\n",
      "signed the pledge at our meeting, asserted that his work must decrease\n",
      "in volume in order that he might continue faithful; so I made haste\n",
      "to intercede for him with his employer, but I did not meet with that\n",
      "encouragement which I had hoped for. Brother Tomple intimated that\n",
      "temperance was temperance and business was business, and even made some\n",
      "remarks which have since seemed to me to contain implications that I\n",
      "was unduly concerned about his affairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tomple’s a--a hog, if he _is_ a church member,” replied the irreverent\n",
      "Crupp; “but he’s got to make himself useful if plain talk will do it.\n",
      "It takes all kinds of men to make a world, parson, or to make men act\n",
      "like men to their neighbors. Perhaps if you preachers come down on rich\n",
      "men who hoard their money, and poor men that are about as stingy with\n",
      "how-d’ye-do’s, and if business men show the public that it’s as cheap\n",
      "to reform a pauper as it is to support him, and that it isn’t the thing\n",
      "to stand by, while a man’s killing himself, without sayin’ a word or\n",
      "spendin’ a cent to prevent him--perhaps we can be of some use in the\n",

      "REFORM WITH MONEY IN IT.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Adams, driver of the brick-yard wagon, and signer of one of the\n",
      "pledges circulated at the great temperance meeting, was certainly\n",
      "a man worth saving. He had a wife and was rich in children. His\n",
      "wife was faithful, good-natured, and industrious, and his children\n",
      "were of that bright, irrepressible nature which is about the most\n",
      "valuable of inheritances in this land where other inheritances do not\n",
      "average largely in money value. For the good of such a group it was\n",
      "very desirable that the head of the family should be in the constant\n",
      "possession of strong arms and all his wits. And even for his own\n",
      "sake Tom was worth a great deal more attention than men of his kind\n",
      "ever receive. He was perfectly honest, a hard worker, cheerier in\n",
      "temperament than any pastor in the village, quicker-witted than most of\n",
      "the lawyers within the judicial circuit upon which the town of Barton\n",
      "was situated, and more generous in proportion to his means than any\n",
      "of his well-to-do fellow-citizens. During the season for making and\n",
      "delivering bricks he worked from sunrise to sunset, rendered fair\n",
      "count to seller and buyer, and never abused his employer’s horses.\n",
      "His regular pay was seventy-five cents per day, which sum, in a land\n",
      "where flour was sold at two cents per pound and meat was only twice as\n",
      "high as flour, and a comfortable house could be hired at four dollars\n",
      "per month, paid his family expenses. But the season at the brick-yard\n",
      "lasted only during six months of the twelve. During the remaining six\n",
      "months Tom gladly did any work he could find: he drove teams where any\n",
      "hauling was to be done, chopped wood, worked in the pork-houses where\n",
      "merchants prepared for the Southern market the fatted hogs which were\n",
      "the principal legal-tenders for the indebtedness of farmer customers,\n",
      "formed part of the crew of one of the many flatboats which conveyed the\n",
      "meat to market, and did whatever other work he could find. But in the\n",
      "winter season, when the family appetite was most industrious, Tom could\n",
      "not find employment for all his time, while the merchants who trusted\n",
      "him made more frequent requests for money than Tom was able to honor.\n",
      "When he was idle, he found himself more welcome at the liquor-shops\n",
      "than anywhere else; when he grew despondent at his inability to pay, he\n",
      "sought solace at these same places; when in the steady work and long\n",
      "hours of the summer season he became gradually “worked out” and “used\n",
      "up”--experiences not infrequent with Tom--he went to the liquor-shops\n",
      "for the only relief he had ever been able to find. His experience did\n",
      "not differ greatly from that of men of higher social standing, who,\n",
      "under similar mental and physical conditions, drink high-priced wines.\n",
      "He gradually increased the quantity of his potations, and went through\n",
      "the successive experiences of being unmanned by liquor, striving to\n",
      "rebuild himself by the power which had broken him, becoming by turns\n",
      "gay, silly, boisterous, pugnacious, sullen, apathetic, and finally\n",
      "penitent. Each of his sprees cost him several days in time and several\n",
      "dollars in money--a fact which no one realized more clearly than Tom\n",
      "himself; yet the feeling which had made him take the first drinks of\n",
      "these frightful series was one which had its seat in his own better\n",
      "nature, and which he had many times found more powerful than every\n",
      "influence he could bring to bear against it. He had listened to many\n",
      "a private lecture on the subject of his weakness, and had honestly\n",
      "admitted the truth of all that was said to him on the subject; he had\n",
      "signed many a pledge in the most agonized earnest, and had broken every\n",
      "one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Monday which followed the temperance meeting Tom Adams was\n",
      "nearly frantic with his old longing. The rest of Sunday had been a\n",
      "hindrance rather than a help to him, for he had already suffered\n",
      "several days from the effects of abstaining from his usual after-dinner\n",
      "and after-supper potations. The amount usually drank on these occasions\n",
      "had not been great, but the habit had for some years been so regular\n",
      "that his amazed and indignant physique protested against the change.\n",
      "Had he been capable of spiritually withdrawing himself from the\n",
      "world on the day of the Lord, he might have found help and strength;\n",
      "but he was as incapable of such a thing as were nine-tenths of the\n",
      "church-members in Barton. While he remained at home, his children were\n",
      "noisy enough to have hurried a rapt seer back to the realization of\n",
      "earthly things; when he went abroad he could not, as was his usual\n",
      "Sunday habit, step quietly into the back door of Bayne’s liquor-store.\n",
      "He strolled down to the stable-yard of the Barton House, hoping to\n",
      "find some one with whom he could talk horse; but the hostler was not\n",
      "in sight, and the stable-boy, who had been heard to say he “didn’t\n",
      "count much on them fellers what signed the pledge and went back on\n",
      "their friends,” eyed him with evident disgust. In the street he met\n",
      "people going to and from church and Sunday-school, and they looked at\n",
      "him as if their eyes were asking, “Are you keeping your pledge?” Then,\n",
      "to crown all, his wife gave him such a beseeching and yet doubting look\n",
      "every time he left the house and returned to it that he almost hated\n",
      "the good woman for her affectionate anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was up bright and early Monday morning, and though he soon mounted\n",
      "his wagon and left his wife’s eyes behind him, he found his longing for\n",
      "liquor as close to him as ever. Reaching the brick-yard, he was rather\n",
      "startled to find there Deacon Jones, his employer, and owner of a store\n",
      "as well as the kilns. The deacon looked at him as all the religious\n",
      "people had done on Sunday, and Tom inwardly cursed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you, Tom?” inquired the deacon, and then, without waiting for\n",
      "a reply, remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s somethin’ I’ve been a-wantin’ to talk to you ’bout, Tom, an’\n",
      "I was sure o’ catchin’ you here, so I came over before breakfast. You\n",
      "signed the pledge t’other night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This latter clause was delivered with an accompanying glance which\n",
      "caused Tom to put a great deal of anger into his reply, although his\n",
      "words were few.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, an’ kep’ it, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad of it, Tom. There’s been times when you didn’t, you know.\n",
      "Well, what I want to say is this: Some folks say that some men drink\n",
      "because they have to work too hard, an’ because they have trouble.\n",
      "Now, mebbe--I only say mebbe, mind--_mebbe_ that’s what upset you\n",
      "those other times. Now, if I was to give you work all the year round\n",
      "at seventy-five cents a day, an’ not work you more’n ten hours a day,\n",
      "would it help you to keep straight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would it?” said Tom, scratching his head, wrinkling his brows, and\n",
      "eying the deacon incredulously “Why, of course it would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said the deacon, “I’ll do it. As long as the brick\n",
      "business is good you can work at haulin’ from seven to twelve, an’\n",
      "one to six. Don’t you s’pose you could put two or three hundred more\n",
      "brick on a load without hurtin’ the hosses? I don’t want to lose any\n",
      "more’n I can help, you know, by cuttin’ down your time. Rainy days I’ll\n",
      "keep you busy at the store some way; them’s the days farmers can’t do\n",
      "much on the farm, so they bring their butter and eggs to town, and\n",
      "there’s a sight of measurin’ an’ weighin’ to be done. An’ after the\n",
      "brick season’s over I’ll find you somethin’ to do at the store. You can\n",
      "put the pork-house an’ warehouse to rights before the packin’ season\n",
      "begins, an’ you can weigh the corn an’ wheat an’ oats an’ pork when\n",
      "they come in, and mend bags, and work in the pork-house three months\n",
      "out of the six. You wouldn’t object to takin’ night-spells in the\n",
      "pork-house instead of day-spells, would you, when we have to work day\n",
      "_and_ night? Night-wages costs us most, you know, an’ you ought to help\n",
      "us make up what we lose on you when there’s nothin’ doin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as _you_ say,” replied Tom. He did not clasp the deacon in a\n",
      "grateful embrace, for the deacon had, in his thrifty way, prevented\n",
      "Tom from feeling especially grateful. The owner of the brick-yard had\n",
      "intimated that the new arrangement was for Tom’s especial benefit, but\n",
      "his later remarks caused this feature of the arrangement to speedily\n",
      "disappear from view. But, although not doubting for an instant that\n",
      "the deacon meant to get his money back with usury, Tom felt his heart\n",
      "growing lighter every moment. At the same time he felt angry at the\n",
      "deacon’s occasional suggestions that the arrangements were partly of\n",
      "the nature of charity. So he replied:\n",
      "\n",

      "for work I don’t do, _you_ know that. The arrangement suits me\n",
      "first-rate, but I’m goin’ to work hard for my money; you can bet all\n",
      "your loose change on _that_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thomas!” ejaculated the deacon sternly, “I am not in the habit of\n",
      "betting. It’s a careless, foolish, wasteful, sinful way of using money.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nary drop,” said Tom, with great emphasis. “Ten minutes ago I wouldn’t\n",
      "have given a pewter dime for my chance of sticking it out through the\n",

      "so strong about bein’ our brothers’ keepers the very next day. ’Twas\n",
      "a Christian act for me to do, too. ‘He that converteth a sinner from\n",
      "the error of his ways’--ah! blessed be the promises. An’ I won’t lose\n",
      "a cent by the operation--_I_ can keep him busy enough. When folks\n",
      "know what I’ve done an’ what I done it for, I guess they’ll think\n",
      "I’ve got my good streaks after all. I declare, I ought to have told\n",
      "him I couldn’t pay for days when he was sick; ’tain’t too late yet,\n",
      "though--he won’t back out on _that_ account. Mebbe I can talk him into\n",
      "j’ining the church, too--who knows, an’ some day in ’xperience meetin’\n",
      "mebbe he’ll tell how it all came about through me. He must bring his\n",
      "dinners with him when he’s workin’ about the store. I ought to have\n",
      "done that with my clerk before he took to lunchin’ off the crackers and\n",

      "\n",
      "“Bless the Lord for the first fruits of the seed so newly sown. Who\n",

      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "\n",
      "AN ASTONISHED VIRGINIAN.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why old Bunley had made Barton his place of residence nobody knew.\n",
      "The most plausible theory ever advanced on the subject came from the\n",
      "former proprietor of the Barton House, who said that Bunley, happening\n",
      "to be traveling that way, had found the brandy at the Barton House\n",
      "so good that he hadn’t the heart to leave it. The brandy lasted so\n",
      "long that old Bunley--then twenty years younger--while consuming it\n",
      "became acquainted with nearly everybody in the town; and as he had\n",
      "no engagements that restrained him from making himself agreeable, he\n",
      "found himself well liked, and entreated to make his home at Barton.\n",
      "He reported--and his report was afterward verified--that he was the\n",
      "son of a Virginia planter, and was unpopular at home because he had\n",
      "made a runaway match with a splendid girl, whose only fault was that\n",
      "her family did not rank very high. Bunley’s father had cut his son off\n",
      "with a thousand dollars, but had considerately sent the money with the\n",
      "letter of dismissal; so the happy couple were leisurely spending the\n",
      "money and waiting for the old gentleman to relent, as irate fathers\n",
      "always do in books. But while Bunley was enjoying the hospitalities\n",
      "of Barton, annoyed only by the fact that his purse was growing light,\n",
      "he heard of his father’s sudden death and of the inheritance by an\n",
      "unloving brother of the entire estate. Then the young bridegroom\n",
      "attempted to obtain money by borrowing, for this was the only method of\n",
      "money-getting he understood; but the small success which attended his\n",
      "efforts did not pay for the annoyance which his soulless creditors gave\n",
      "him. Then he tried gambling, and, by devoting his mind to it, succeeded\n",
      "so well that no one but an occasional commercial traveler, to whom\n",
      "Bunley’s ways were unknown, would play with him. Then, under the guise\n",
      "of being clerk of the Barton House, he became its actual barkeeper, and\n",
      "attracted so much custom away from the other liquor-sellers that the\n",
      "grateful proprietor took him into partnership, and, dying a year later,\n",
      "bequeathed the whole business to him. But the good brandy which had\n",
      "first persuaded Bunley to stop at Barton continued its fascinations,\n",
      "and the new proprietor of the Barton House, while liked by all\n",
      "travelers, grew so unpopular with purveyors of flour, meat, and other\n",
      "hotel necessities that the sheriff was finally called upon to settle\n",
      "the differences between them by disposing of the hotel property at\n",
      "auction.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that Bunley ran to seed, to use an expression common in Barton.\n",
      "How he lived during the twenty years which followed was not well\n",
      "understood. His wife died, and it was understood that he married\n",
      "some money the second time; but it was none the less whispered about\n",
      "town that Bunley had been seen at night to borrow at woodpiles whose\n",
      "owners he had not consulted. He went upon mighty sprees, and carried\n",
      "the bouquet of liquor wherever he went. He started a small groggery\n",
      "of his own, in which many bright boys learned to drink. He had long\n",
      "since ruined the credit which he obtained on the strength of his second\n",
      "wife’s property, for he never paid an account.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet the most aggrieved of Bunley’s creditors could not help being\n",
      "soft-hearted when they saw the old man in church, as he was every\n",
      "Sunday morning with his two boys. The gentleman which was in old Bunley\n",
      "then showed itself in his face and manner, and it _did_ seem too bad\n",
      "that any one who could look and act so much like a man should not be\n",
      "trusted to the extent of a dollar’s worth of sugar or a hundred pounds\n",
      "of flour. Squire Tomple had thought so one Sunday, and as the Squire\n",
      "strove to keep worldly thoughts out of his mind on the Lord’s day, his\n",
      "mind became filled with old Bunley--so much so, that on the following\n",
      "Monday he decoyed Bunley into his store, and talked so pleasantly to\n",
      "him that the old gentleman actually made the request for which the\n",
      "Squire hoped. He bought rather more than the Squire had meant to sell\n",
      "him on credit, but his promise of early payment was so distinct and\n",
      "emphatic that the Squire’s doubt was not fairly established for many\n",
      "months. This story in all its details was told by the Squire to Mr.\n",
      "Crupp, after that gentleman announced to him that something should be\n",
      "done for old Bunley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was because you didn’t go about the job in the right way,” said\n",
      "Crupp. “He’s got just enough conceit to suppose that he’s going to pay\n",
      "all his bills some day, and he feels that when the time comes your\n",
      "profit’ll pay for your kindness. That conceit of his is just what needs\n",
      "to be taken down--it’s got to be done kindly--so that he understands\n",
      "that whatever he gets comes out of pure charity and the desire to make\n",
      "him comfortable, even at a loss. Now, he and his little family can live\n",
      "on about a dollar a day. I’ll stand half the expense of supporting him\n",
      "for three months if you’ll do the other half, and we’ll talk plain,\n",
      "good-natured English to him, and let him understand he’s a pauper.\n",
      "That’ll put him on his mettle. What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire looked grave at once--as grave as he had appeared when\n",
      "an uninsured hogshead of sugar belonging to him had fallen from a\n",
      "steamboat gang-plank into the river, and melted. The proposition seemed\n",
      "to take his breath away, in fact; but in a moment or two he regained it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, Crupp,” said he, “temperance is all very well; but I don’t\n",
      "think it’s my business to stand part of the expenses of reforming\n",
      "everybody, when I haven’t had anything to do with making drunkards.\n",
      "With you the case is different. You say your liquors were always good;\n",
      "but, like enough, that made men all the fonder of drinking the infernal\n",
      "things. You’re a public-spirited citizen, but you can’t deny that\n",
      "you’ve had a thousand times more to do with making drunkards than I\n",
      "have. The very fact that you _are_ a decent fellow yourself has made\n",
      "drinking halfway respectable in Barton. The crime’s right at your own\n",
      "door, and you ought to pay for it. You----”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire paused. Mr. Crupp’s face was very white and his teeth were\n",
      "tightly set. Mr. Crupp _had_ been known to throw a disorderly visitor\n",
      "at his bar halfway across the street; and although the Squire knew that\n",
      "his own avoirdupois was too great to be treated so contemptuously, he\n",
      "had no desire to feel the weight of Crupp’s fist. Besides, Crupp was a\n",
      "customer who bought a great deal and paid promptly, and the Squire did\n",
      "not like to offend him and lose his custom. So the Squire paused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go right on,” said Mr. Crupp very quietly. “I’ll not bear any malice.\n",
      "I’ve said a great many worse things to myself. Don’t hold in anything\n",
      "you’ve got on your mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m done,” said the Squire, looking relieved and extending his hand.\n",
      "“Crupp, I think a good deal of you, and I’m ashamed of myself for\n",
      "boiling over as I did. But folks talk to me as if I was made of money.\n",
      "I paid out a good deal on the expense of the meeting; the parson’s\n",
      "been at me to help every lazy drunkard to get work; George Doughty\n",
      "wants more pay or less work, so he won’t have such a hankering after\n",
      "liquor; and now to be asked to help old Bunley, that’s owed me money a\n",
      "long time and never paid it, that came near helping one of my boys to a\n",
      "taste for liquor, that helps himself at my woodpile--it’s _too_ much,\n",
      "that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Squire,” said Crupp, “isn’t there something in your Bible that’s not\n",
      "complimentary to men who say to the needy, ‘Depart: be ye warmed and\n",
      "fed,’ but don’t put their hands into their pockets to help the poor\n",
      "wretches along? I tell you that a man that’s got the love of drink\n",
      "fixed in every muscle in his body and every drop of his blood is worse\n",
      "off than any cold and hungry man you ever saw. Such men _sometimes_\n",
      "help themselves out of their trouble, and stick to cold water; but\n",
      "the man that does it is more of a hero, and he’s got better stuff in\n",
      "him, than any other sort of sinner that ever repents. He’s got to be\n",
      "helped just like drowning men have to be, and you’ve got to take hold\n",
      "of him just as you do of a drowning man, by whatever part you can get\n",
      "the tightest grip on. Bunley’s pride’s the only handle you can find on\n",
      "_him_, and you can’t get at _that_ except by showing that you think\n",
      "enough of him to sink money in him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire cast about in his mind for some argument in defense of his\n",
      "money; but, as he found none, he acted like a good diplomatist, and\n",
      "started to talk against time by uttering some promising generalizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always meant, and I still mean,” said he, “to do good with my money.\n",
      "That’s what it was given me for. I’m only the Lord’s steward----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And right here in Barton is where the Lord put you to do it,” said\n",
      "Crupp. “Here’s where you made your money; here are the people who know\n",
      "you and don’t suspect you of caring any less for your money than other\n",
      "folks do for theirs; here are the people you know all about; you know\n",
      "their weaknesses and their good points, and every dollar you spend on\n",
      "them you can watch, and see that it does its duty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I _know_ that helping a man will be sure to reform him,” began\n",
      "the Squire, when again his companion interrupted him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ever read of Christ’s letting a man suffer for fear that if\n",
      "he cured him or fed him he might get sick or hungry again? If I read\n",
      "straight, _he_ helped everybody that came to him, and everybody that\n",
      "needed help. I suppose loafers were as thick in Judæa as they are in\n",
      "Barton; why, when he healed those ten lepers there was only one of\n",
      "them decent enough to come back and say “Thank you.” _I’ve_ got money\n",
      "enough to take Bunley on my own shoulders for a little while, and I’m\n",
      "going to spend a good deal on such fellows; but they want to see that\n",
      "they’re thought something of by men who never sold whisky, who never\n",
      "made anything out of them, who are enough in earnest to do something\n",
      "for them that costs more than talk does. I know it isn’t easy, but it’s\n",
      "got to be done--that is, if Christianity is true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crupp’s last shot told. Squire Tomple was orthodox, but he was\n",
      "not without reflective capacity, and many had been his twinges of\n",
      "conscience at his practical rejection of undoubted deductions which he\n",
      "had drawn from Christ’s teachings and example. But on this particular\n",
      "occasion, as on many others, he was not defeated; he was only\n",
      "temporarily demoralized. In a moment he was on the defensive again,\n",
      "and suddenly raised his head and opened his lips; but, whatever his\n",
      "idea was, it remained unspoken; for in the eye of Crupp, which had been\n",
      "intently scrutinizing his face and through it his heart, he detected\n",
      "a softness and haziness unusual in the eyes of men. The Squire, not\n",
      "without a struggle, became at once shamefaced and obedient, and said\n",
      "hurriedly,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crupp, you’re a good, square man; I’m proud to know you, and I’ll do\n",
      "what you like--for old Bunley, that is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the surprise of Bunley himself, when he answered a knock\n",
      "at his door a few minutes later, to find Squire Tomple and Mr. Crupp\n",
      "upon his front stoop, both of them looking and acting as if extremely\n",
      "embarrassed. But old Bunley never forgot his Virginia breeding, not\n",
      "even before a couple of creditors; so he invited both gentlemen to\n",
      "seats on the top step, and then sat down between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire looked appealingly at Crupp; Crupp winked encouragingly\n",
      "at the Squire; the Squire coughed feebly; Crupp plucked a stem of\n",
      "timothy grass, and gazed at it as if he had never seen such a thing\n",
      "before; the Squire took out a pocket-knife, and began to scrape his\n",
      "finger-nails, and then Crupp remarked that it was a fine day. Bunley\n",
      "having cheerfully assented to this expression of opinion, there was\n",
      "a moment or two of awkward silence, which was finally relieved by\n",
      "Bunley, who drew from his pocket a plug of tobacco, from which he took\n",
      "a bite, after first offering it to his visitors. A little more facial\n",
      "pantomime went on between Tomple and Crupp, and then the Squire spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bunley,” said he, “you don’t seem to get along very fast in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a fact,” answered Bunley with hearty emphasis. “Luck seems to\n",
      "go against me, no matter how I lay myself out. There ain’t a man in\n",
      "this town that wants to do the right thing any more than I do, but\n",
      "somehow I don’t get the chance. I signed the pledge t’other night at\n",
      "the meetin’; but how I’m goin’ to stick to it, with all the trouble I’m\n",
      "in, is more than I can see through.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve come down to help you do it,” said the Squire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To help you with money--not talk,” supplemented Crupp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bunley looked at both men quickly, from under the extreme inner edge of\n",
      "his upper eyelid.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We propose, between us, to show you that we’re in dead earnest to\n",
      "help you keep the pledge,” continued the Squire. “We’re going to give\n",
      "you, week after week, whatever you need to live on for the next three\n",
      "months, so you won’t have any excuse for drinking to drown trouble, and\n",
      "so you’ll have a chance to find something to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Old Bunley sprang to his feet. “Gentlemen,” said he, “you’re--you’re\n",
      "_gentlemen_. It’s the first time in my life that anybody ever cared\n",
      "_that_ much for me, though. You shan’t lose anything by it, I promise\n",
      "you _that_; I’ll pay you back again the first chance I get to make\n",
      "anything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t _want_ it back,” said Crupp. “We won’t _take_ it back. We\n",
      "want to _give_ it to you, out and out----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To show you that it’s _you_ that we’re interested in, not ourselves,”\n",
      "interrupted the Squire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Old Virginia came to the surface again; Bunley seemed to grow an\n",
      "inch or two, and to swell several more as he replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not a pauper, gentlemen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not,” said the Squire hastily; “but you can’t pay your debts\n",
      "nor your current expenses, and Crupp and I are a little ahead in the\n",

      "On a pleasant August evening, at that particular portion of the day\n",
      "in which twilight shades into night, Fred Macdonald left his father’s\n",
      "house and walked toward the opposite portion of the village. From his\n",
      "leisurely, elastic gait, the artistic effect of his necktie, the pose\n",
      "of his hat, the rose-bud in his button-hole, and the graceful carriage\n",
      "of his cane, it was very evident that Frederick’s steps did not tend\n",
      "toward the fulfillment of any prosaic business engagement. It was not\n",
      "so dark that he could not recognize, in occasional unlighted windows,\n",
      "certain faces well known, some of them handsome, all of them pleasing;\n",
      "nor was it too dark, just after Fred had bestowed a bow and a smile\n",
      "upon the occupant of each of these windows, and passed on, for one to\n",
      "discern, by the expressions upon most of the faces that slowly turned\n",
      "and looked after the young man, that Fred need not have gone farther\n",
      "in search of a cordial welcome. But he walked on until he reached the\n",
      "residence of the Rev. Jonas Wedgewell. To any one not a resident of\n",
      "Barton the house might have seemed a strange one to be visited by a\n",
      "young man fond of liquor and the company frequently found on Western\n",
      "steamboats; and the stranger’s surprise might have increased, at\n",
      "finding that Fred had been so frequent a visitor that even the house\n",
      "itself seemed glad to see him, and that the heavy old door seemingly\n",
      "opened of its own accord, before Fred’s fingers had time to touch its\n",
      "antique knocker. But had the supposititious observer possessed good\n",
      "eyes, whose actual powers were temporarily increased by the stimulus of\n",
      "curiosity, his bewilderment would have ended a second later; for, as\n",
      "Fred stepped inside the hall, there came from behind the door a small\n",
      "hand, and then a dainty ruffle, and then a muslin sleeve, and these all\n",
      "took their direction toward the shoulder of Fred’s coat; while there\n",
      "followed a profile which the beholder would have willingly gazed upon\n",
      "longer, had it not almost instantaneously disappeared behind that side\n",
      "of Fred’s face which was farthest from the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could the observer’s gaze have penetrated the window shades of Parson\n",
      "Wedgewell’s little parlor, he would have seen a face, not girlish\n",
      "or of regular features, and yet so full of happiness that its effect\n",
      "was that of absolute beauty and the innocence of youth. There were\n",
      "estimable maidens in Barton who, scorning the thought that they\n",
      "could be either jealous or envious, had frequently remarked to their\n",
      "intimates that they could _not_ see what men found in Esther Wedgewell\n",
      "to rave about, and it was well known that the mystery had never been\n",
      "satisfactorily explained to such young ladies as had become the wives\n",
      "of men who had been among Miss Esther’s admirers. It is even to be\n",
      "doubted whether Fred Macdonald himself could have verbally elucidated\n",
      "the matter; there _have_ been such cases where long and joyous\n",
      "lifetimes have not sufficed in which to frame such an explanation, and\n",
      "when the person most blessed has had to journey into another world in\n",
      "search of adequate power of expression. Ordinarily Esther Wedgewell\n",
      "was a young lady the pleasantness of whose face did not hide the fact\n",
      "that its owner’s forehead was too high, the nose too short, the mouth\n",
      "too large, and the complexion too pale for perfect beauty. But somehow\n",
      "young men noticed first of all Miss Esther’s eyes, and these, though\n",
      "neither of heavenly blue, nor violet, nor the brownness of nuts, nor\n",
      "large, nor melting, but only plain gray, were so honest in themselves,\n",
      "and so sympathetic for others, that no one of any character cared to\n",
      "gaze from them to any other of the young woman’s features.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Fred and Esther said to each other during the first few minutes\n",
      "after their meeting, was of a nature which never shows to full\n",
      "advantage in print; besides, it was in the nature of things that they\n",
      "should say very little. In spite of the experience accumulated during\n",
      "a hundred or more of just such meetings, it seemed necessary that a\n",
      "few minutes should be consumed by Fred in assuring himself that it\n",
      "was really Esther who sat in the rocking-chair in front of him; and\n",
      "the same time was used by the lady in determining that the handsome,\n",
      "intelligent face in front of her was that of the only lover she had\n",
      "ever accepted. Gradually, however, the sentences spoken by the couple\n",
      "became longer and more frequent; their subjects were ordinary enough;\n",
      "being the mutual acquaintances they had met during the day; the\n",
      "additions which had been made to the embroidery on the pair of slippers\n",
      "which Esther, after the manner of most other betrothed maidens in\n",
      "America, had begun to make for her lover; the quality of the singing\n",
      "in church on the preceding Sunday; the latest news from Captain Hall’s\n",
      "expedition to the North Pole; the character of Shakespeare’s Portia;\n",
      "and yet one would have supposed, from the countenances of both of these\n",
      "young people, that in each of these topics there was some underlying\n",
      "motive of the most delightful import; while their remarks seemed\n",
      "to indicate that there was but one side to either of the subjects\n",
      "discussed, and that both Fred and Esther saw it with the extreme\n",
      "clearness of earthly comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in a lull in the conversation, Fred asked, with a courtesy and\n",
      "minuteness inherited from aristocratic parents, about Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "Wedgewell, and elicited the information that Esther’s father was\n",
      "composing a second sermon on intemperance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your father undoubtedly is himself the best judge of the needs of his\n",
      "congregation,” said Fred, dropping his eyes a little and playing with\n",
      "a bit of paper; “but I can’t help feeling that he is wasting his fine\n",
      "talents in preaching on intemperance. If his sermons could be heard and\n",
      "applied by the proper persons, they might do a great deal of good; but\n",
      "what drunkard goes to church? Only moderate drinkers and people who\n",
      "don’t drink at all ever hear your father’s sermons, and none of them\n",
      "have any need for such instructions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther brushed an imaginary thread or mote from her dress, and said,\n",
      "with some embarrassment,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father believes that the moderate drinkers are those who most need to\n",
      "be warned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Ettie!” exclaimed Fred, “how can he believe that? He must know\n",
      "that I occasionally--that is, he knows that I am not one of the Sons of\n",
      "Temperance; yet he gave me you”--here conversation ceased a moment as\n",
      "Fred stepped toward Esther, conveying unto that lady an affectionate\n",
      "testimonial whose exact nature will be understood--“and he certainly\n",
      "would not have done so had he supposed I was in any danger of being\n",
      "injured by liquor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther did not wait even until she had finished rearranging a\n",
      "disordered tress or two to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said ‘yes,’ only after I told him of your promise to me that you\n",
      "would not drink any more after we were married. He said you were the\n",
      "best born and best bred young man he had ever met--as if I didn’t\n",
      "already know it, you dear boy--but that he would rather bury me than\n",
      "let me marry a drinking man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During the delivery of this short speech Fred looked by turns\n",
      "astonished, sober, flattered, sullen, indignant, and finally\n",
      "business-like and judicial. Then he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Darling, you must let me believe that your father is not fully posted\n",
      "about men who take an occasional glass. It’s no fault of his; he\n",
      "probably never tasted a drop of liquor in his life--he may never have\n",
      "felt the need of it. But believe me when I tell you that many of the\n",
      "smartest men drink sometimes, and are greatly helped by it. A business\n",
      "man whose daily life can’t help being often irregular, sometimes finds\n",
      "he can’t get along without something to help him through the day. Why,\n",
      "a few days ago I helped Sam Crayme, captain of the “Excellence,” you\n",
      "know, at a difficult bit of business; I worked thirty-six hours on a\n",
      "stretch, and made fifty dollars by it. That’s more money than any of\n",
      "your young temperance men of Barton ever make in a month, but I never\n",
      "could have done it if it hadn’t been for an occasional drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” said Esther, “you know I don’t say it by way of complaint, Fred\n",
      "dear, but for a week after that you felt dull and didn’t say much, and\n",
      "didn’t care to read, and one evening when I expected you you didn’t\n",
      "come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But think how tired a man must be after such a job, Ettie,” pleaded\n",
      "Fred in an injured tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You poor old fellow, I know it,” said Esther; “but you wouldn’t have\n",
      "been so if you hadn’t done the work, and you yourself say you couldn’t\n",
      "have done the work if you hadn’t drunk the liquor, and you know you\n",
      "didn’t need the money so badly as to have had to do so much. Any\n",
      "merchant in the town would be glad to give you employment at which you\n",
      "would be your own natural self.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I would always be a poor man if I worked for our plodding,\n",
      "small-paying merchants,” said Fred. “Why, Ettie, who own the handsomest\n",
      "houses in town, who have the best horses, who set the best tables,\n",
      "whose wives and children wear the best clothes? Why, Moshier and Brown\n",
      "and Crayme and Wainright, every one of them moderate drinkers; I never\n",
      "in my life saw one of them drunk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I would rather be dead than be the wife of any one of them,”\n",
      "said Esther with an energy which startled Fred. “Mrs. Moshier used to\n",
      "be such a happy-looking woman, and now she is so quiet and has such\n",
      "sad eyes. Brown seems to spend no end of money on his family; but his\n",
      "children are always put to bed before he comes home, because he is as\n",
      "likely as not to be cross and unkind to them; when they meet him on\n",
      "the street they never shout ‘Papa!’ and rush up to him as your little\n",
      "brothers and sisters do to _your_ father; but they look at him first\n",
      "with an anxious look that’s enough to break one’s heart, and as likely\n",
      "as not cross the street to avoid meeting him. Mrs. Crayme was having\n",
      "_such_ a pleasant time at Nellie Wainright’s party the other night,\n",
      "when her husband, who she seldom enough has a chance to take into\n",
      "society with her, said such silly things and stared around with such\n",
      "an odd look in his eye that she made some excuse to take him home. And\n",
      "Nellie Wainright--she was my particular friend before she was married,\n",
      "you know--was here a few days ago, and I was telling her how happy I\n",
      "was, when suddenly she threw both arms around my neck and burst out\n",
      "crying, and told me that she hoped that my husband would never drink\n",
      "after I was married. She insists upon it that her husband is the best\n",
      "man that ever lived, and that if she only mentions anything she would\n",
      "like, she has it at once if money can buy it, and yet she is unhappy.\n",
      "She says there’s always a load on her heart, and though she feels real\n",
      "wicked about it, she can’t get rid of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Macdonald was unable for some moments to reply to this unexpected\n",
      "speech; he arose from his chair, and walked slowly up and down the\n",
      "room, with his hands behind him, and with the countenance natural to\n",
      "a man who has heard something of which he had previously possessed no\n",
      "idea. Esther looked at him, first furtively, then tenderly; then she\n",
      "sprang to his side and leaned upon his shoulder, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Fred, I know _you_ could never be that way; but then all these\n",
      "women were sure they knew just the same about their lovers, before they\n",
      "were married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Ettie,” said Fred, passing an arm about the young lady, “I\n",
      "really don’t know what’s to be done about it, if drinking moderately is\n",
      "the cause of all these dreadful things; I’m bound to _be_ somebody; I’m\n",
      "in the set of men that make money; they like me, and I understand them.\n",
      "But they all take something, and you don’t know how they look at a man\n",
      "who refuses to drink with them; all of them think he don’t amount to\n",
      "much, and some of them actually feel insulted. What is a fellow to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go into some other set, I suppose,” said Esther very soberly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know what you’re saying, my dear girl,” said Fred. “What\n",
      "else is there for a man to do in a dead-and-alive place like Barton?\n",
      "you don’t want to be the wife of a four-hundred-dollar clerk, and live\n",
      "in part of a common little house, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Esther, showing her lover a rapturous face whose\n",
      "attractiveness was not marred by a suspicion of shyness. “I do, if Fred\n",
      "Macdonald is to be my husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then if either of us should have a long illness, or if I should lose\n",
      "my position, we would have to depend on your parents and mine,” said\n",
      "Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us wait, then,” said Esther, “until you can have saved something,\n",
      "before we are married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be like Charley Merrick and Kate Armstrong, who’ve been engaged\n",

      "succeed,” said Esther, in a tone which might have carried conviction\n",
      "with it had Fred been entirely in a listening humor. But as Fred\n",
      "imagined himself in the position of the many unsuccessful young men\n",
      "in Barton, and of the anxious-looking husbands who had once been as\n",
      "spirited as himself, he fell into a frame of mind which was anything\n",
      "but receptive. In his day-dreams marriage had seemed made up of many\n",
      "things beside the perpetual companionship of Esther: it had among its\n",
      "very desirable components a handsome, well-furnished house, a carriage\n",
      "of the most approved style, an elegant wardrobe for Esther, and one\n",
      "of faultless style for himself, a prominent pew in church, and, not\n",
      "least of all, a sideboard which should be better stocked than that of\n",
      "any of his friends. To banish these from his mind for a moment, and\n",
      "imagine himself living in two or three rooms; cheapening meat at the\n",
      "butcher’s; never driving out but when he could borrow somebody’s horse\n",
      "and antiquated buggy; wearing a suit of clothes for two or three years\n",
      "in succession, while Esther should spend hours in making over and over\n",
      "the dresses of her unmarried days; all this made him almost deaf to\n",
      "Esther’s loyal words, and nearly oblivious to the fact that the wisest\n",
      "and sweetest girl in Barton was resting within his arm. Suddenly he\n",
      "aroused himself from his revery, and exclaimed, in a tone which Esther\n",
      "did not at first recognize as his own,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ettie, your ideas are honest and lofty, but you must admit that\n",
      "I know best about matters of business. I can’t deliberately throw\n",
      "away everything I have done, and form entirely different business\n",
      "connections. I’ve always regretted my promise to stop drinking after\n",
      "our marriage; but I’ve trusted that you, with your unusual sense, would\n",
      "see the propriety of absolving me from it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther shrank away from Fred, and hid her face in her hands, whispering\n",
      "hoarsely,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t. I can’t, and I never will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped into a chair and burst into tears. Fred’s momentary\n",
      "expression of anger softened into sorrow, but his business instinct did\n",
      "not desert him. “Ettie,” said he tenderly, “I thought you trusted me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _know_ I do, Fred,” said the weeping girl; “but my lover and\n",
      "the Fred who drinks are two different persons, and I _can’t_ trust\n",
      "the latter. Don’t think me selfish: be always your natural self, and\n",
      "there’s no poverty or sorrow that I won’t endure to be always with you.\n",
      "Do you think I hope to marry you for the sake of living in luxury, or\n",
      "that any pleasures that money will buy will satisfy me any more than\n",
      "they do Nellie Wainright and Mr. Moshier’s wife? Or do you, professing\n",
      "to love me, ask me to run even the slightest risk of ever being as\n",
      "unhappy as the poor women we have been talking about are with their\n",
      "husbands, who love them dearly? You _must_ keep that promise, or I must\n",

      "George Doughty lay propped up in bed; standing beside him, and\n",
      "clasping his hand tightly, was his wife; near him were his two oldest\n",
      "children, seemingly as ignorant of what was transpiring as they were\n",
      "uncomfortable on account of the peculiar influence which pervaded the\n",
      "room. On the other side of the bed, and holding one of the dying man’s\n",
      "hands, knelt Parson Wedgewell; beside him stood the doctor; while\n",
      "behind them both, near the door, and as nearly invisible as a man of\n",
      "his size could be, was Squire Tomple. The Squire’s face and figure\n",
      "seemed embodiments of a trembling, abject apology; he occasionally\n",
      "looked toward the door, as if to question that inanimate object whether\n",
      "behind its broad front he, the Squire, might not be safe from his own\n",
      "fears. It was very evident that the Squire’s conscience was making a\n",
      "coward of him; but it was also evident, and not for the first time\n",
      "in the world’s history, that cowardice is mightily influential in\n",
      "holding a coward to the ground that he hates. Had any one spoken to\n",
      "him, or paid him the slightest attention, the Squire would have felt\n",
      "better; nothing turns cowards into soldiers so quickly as the receipt\n",
      "of a volley; but no such relief seemed at all likely to reach him. The\n",
      "doctor, like a true man, having done all things, could only stand,\n",
      "and stand he did; Parson Wedgewell, feeling that upon his own efforts\n",
      "with the Great Physician depended the sick man’s future well-being,\n",
      "prayed silently and earnestly, raising his head only to search, through\n",
      "his tears, the face of the patient for signs of the desired answer to\n",
      "prayer. Mrs. Doughty was interested only in looking into the eyes too\n",
      "soon to close forever, and the faces of the two children were more than\n",
      "a man could intentionally look upon a second time. So when Doughty’s\n",

      "of an angel, and he stooped--no easy operation for a man of Squire\n",
      "Tomple’s bulk--and, lifting the little fellow in his arms, put kisses\n",
      "all over the tiny face, which, in view of the relations of cleanliness\n",
      "to attractiveness, was not especially bewitching. A moment later,\n",
      "however, a muffled but approaching step brought back to the Squire his\n",
      "own sense of propriety, and he dropped the baby just in time to be able\n",
      "to give a hand to Fred Macdonald, as that young man softly pushed open\n",
      "the door. The Squire’s face again became apologetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did it happen?” whispered Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” replied the Squire, “the doctor says it’s a galloping\n",
      "consumption; _I_ never knew a thing about it. Doctor says it’s the\n",
      "quickest case he ever knew; he never imagined anything was the matter\n",
      "with George. If _I’d_ known anything about it, I’d have had the doctor\n",
      "attending him long ago; but George isn’t of the complaining kind. The\n",
      "idea of a fellow being at work for me, and dying right straight along.\n",
      "Why, it’s awful! He says he never knew anything about it himself, so I\n",
      "don’t see how _I_ could. He was at the store up to four or five days\n",
      "ago, then his wife came around one morning and told me that he didn’t\n",
      "feel fit to work that day, but she didn’t say what the matter was.\n",
      "I’ve been thinking, for two or three weeks, about giving him some help\n",
      "in the store; but you know how business drives everything out of a\n",
      "man’s head. First I thought I’d stay around the store myself evenings,\n",
      "and let George rest; but I’ve had to go to lodge meetings and prayer\n",
      "meetings, and my wife’s wanted me to go out with her, and so my time’s\n",
      "been taken up. Then I thought I’d get a boy, and--well, I didn’t know\n",
      "exactly which to do; but if I’d known----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But can’t something be done to brace him up for a day or two?”\n",
      "interrupted Fred; “then I’ll take him out driving every day, and\n",
      "perhaps he’ll pick up.”\n",

      "The Squire looked twenty years older for a moment or two as he replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“The doctor says he hasn’t any physique to rally upon; he’s all gone,\n",
      "muscle, blood, and everything. It’s the queerest thing I ever knew; he\n",
      "hasn’t had anything to do, these past few years, but just what _I_ did\n",
      "when I was a young man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The dying man turned his eyes inquiringly, and asked in a very thin\n",

      "\n",
      "“Isn’t Fred here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred started from the Squire’s side, but the storekeeper arrested\n",
      "his progress with both hands, and fixing his eyes on Fred’s necktie,\n",
      "whispered,\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t think _I’m_ to blame, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why--no--I don’t see how, exactly,” said Fred, endeavoring to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred,” whispered the Squire, tightening his hold on the lapels of\n",
      "Fred’s coat, “tell _him_ so, won’t you? I’ll be your best friend\n",
      "forever if you will; it’s dreadful to think of a man going up to God\n",
      "with such an idea on his mind, even if it _is_ a mistake. Of course,\n",
      "when he gets there he’ll find out he’s wrong, _if_ he is, as----”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred broke away from the storekeeper, and wedged himself between\n",
      "the doctor and pastor. Doughty withdrew his wrist from the doctor’s\n",
      "fingers, extended a thin hand, and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred,” said he, “we used to be chums when we were boys. I never took\n",
      "an advantage of you, did I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never,” said Fred; “and we’ll have lots of good times again, old\n",
      "fellow. I’ve just bought the best spring wagon in the State, and I’ll\n",
      "drive you all over the country when you get well enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "George’s smile became slightly grim as he replied,\n",
      "\n",

      "again, my boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, George!” exclaimed Fred heartily. “How many times have I\n",
      "seen you almost dead, and then put yourself together again? Don’t\n",
      "you remember the time when you gave out in the middle of the river,\n",
      "and then picked yourself up, and swam the rest of the way? Don’t you\n",
      "remember the time we got snowed in on Raccoon Mountain, and we both\n",
      "gave up and got ready to die, and how you not only came to, but dragged\n",
      "me home besides? The idea of _you_ ever dying! I wish you’d sent for me\n",

      "\n",
      "Doughty was silent for a moment; his eyes brightened a little and a\n",

      "at his children; he tried to raise himself in his bed; but in a minute\n",
      "his smile departed, his pallor returned, and he said, in the thinnest\n",
      "of voices,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no use, Fred; in those days there was something in me to call\n",
      "upon at a pinch; now there isn’t a thing. I haven’t any time to\n",
      "spare, Fred; what I want to ask is, keep an eye on my boys, for old\n",
      "acquaintance’ sake. Their mother will be almost everything to them,\n",
      "but she can’t be expected to know about their ways among men. I want\n",
      "somebody to care enough for them to see that they don’t make the\n",
      "mistakes I’ve made.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden rustle and a heavy step was heard, and Squire Tomple\n",

      "\n",
      "“_I’ll_ do that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Squire,” said George feebly; “but you’re not the right man\n",
      "to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“George,” said the Squire, raising his voice, and unconsciously raising\n",
      "his hand, “I’ll give them the best business chances that can be had; I\n",
      "can do it, for I’m the richest man in this town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You gave _me_ the best chance in town, Squire, and this is what has\n",
      "come of it,” said Doughty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Squire precipitately fell back and against his old place by the\n",
      "wall. Doughty continued,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred, persuade them--tell them that I said so--that a business that\n",
      "makes them drink to keep up, isn’t business at all--it’s suicide. Tell\n",
      "them that their father, who was never drunk in his life, got whisky to\n",
      "help him use more of himself, until there wasn’t anything left to use.\n",
      "Tell them that drinking for strength means discounting the future, and\n",
      "that discounting the future always means getting ready for bankruptcy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll do it, old fellow,” said Fred, who had been growing very solemn\n",
      "of visage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They shan’t ask you for any money, Fred, explained Doughty, when the\n",
      "Squire’s voice was again heard saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“And they shan’t refuse it from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, Squire,” said George. “I do think you owe it to them, but I\n",
      "guess they’ve good enough stuff in them to refuse it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“George,” said the Squire, again approaching the bedside, “I’m going to\n",
      "continue your salary to your wife until your boys grow big enough to\n",
      "help her. You know I’ve got plenty of money--’twon’t hurt me; for God’s\n",
      "sake make her promise to take it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She won’t need it,” said Doughty. “My life’s insured.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then what _can_ I do for her--for them--for you?” asked the Squire.\n",
      "“George, you’re holding your--sickness--against me, and I want to make\n",
      "it right. I can’t say I believe I’ve done wrong by you, but you think I\n",
      "have, and that’s enough to make me want to restore good feeling between\n",
      "us before--in case anything should happen. Anything that money _can_\n",
      "do, it _shall_ do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Offer it to God Almighty, Squire, and buy my life back again,” said\n",
      "Doughty. “If you can’t do that, your money isn’t good for anything in\n",
      "this house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor whispered to his patient that he must not exert himself so\n",
      "much; the Squire whispered to the doctor to know what else a man in his\n",
      "own position could do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Macdonald could think of no appropriate expression with which to\n",
      "break the silence that threatened. Suddenly Parson Wedgewell raised his\n",
      "head, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear young friend, this is a solemn moment. There are others who\n",
      "know and esteem you, beside those here present; have you no message to\n",
      "leave for them? Thousands of people rightly regard you as a young man\n",
      "of high character, and your influence for good may be powerful among\n",
      "them. I should esteem it an especial privilege to announce, in my\n",
      "official capacity, such testimony as you may be moved to make, and as\n",
      "your pastor, I feel like claiming this mournful pleasure as a right.\n",
      "What may I say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say,” replied the sick man, with an earnestness which was almost\n",
      "terrible in its intensity; “say that whisky was the best business\n",
      "friend I ever found, and that when it began to abuse me, no one\n",
      "thought enough of me to step in between us. And tell them that this\n",
      "story is as true as it is ugly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Doughty spoke, he had raised himself upon one elbow; as he uttered\n",
      "his last word, he dropped upon his pillow, and passed into a land to\n",
      "which no one but his wife manifested any willingness to follow him.\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "AN ESTIMABLE ORGANIZATION CRITICISED.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The funeral services of George Doughty were as largely attended\n",
      "as the great temperance meeting had been, and the attendants\n",
      "admitted--although the admission was not, logically, of particular\n",
      "force--that they received the worth of their money. The pall-bearers,\n",
      "twelve in number, were all young men who had been in the habit of\n",
      "drinking, but who had signed the pledge, some of them having appended\n",
      "signatures to special pledges privately prepared on the evening before\n",
      "the service. The funeral anthem was as doleful as the most sincere\n",
      "mourner could have wished, the music having been composed especially\n",
      "for the occasion by the chorister of Mr. Wedgewell’s church. As for the\n",
      "sermon, it was universally voted the most powerful effort that Parson\n",
      "Wedgewell had ever made. Day and night had the good man striven with\n",
      "Doughty’s parting injunction, determined to transmit the exact spirit\n",
      "of it, but horrified at its verbal form. At last he honestly made\n",
      "George’s own words the basis of his whole sermon; his method being,\n",
      "first, to show what would have been naturally the last words of a young\n",
      "man of good birth and Christian breeding, and then presenting George’s\n",
      "moral legacy by way of contrast. To point the moral without offending\n",
      "Squire Tomple’s pride, and without inflicting useless pain upon the\n",
      "Squire’s sufficiently wounded heart, was no easy task; but the parson\n",
      "was not lacking in tact and tenderness, so he succeeded in making of\n",
      "his sermon an appeal so powerful and all-applicable that none of the\n",
      "hearers found themselves at liberty to search out those to whom the\n",
      "sermon might seem personally addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the hearers was Mr. Crupp, and no one seemed more deeply\n",
      "interested and affected. He followed the funeral cortege to the\n",
      "cemetery; but, arrived there, he halted at the gate, instead of\n",
      "following the example of the multitude by crowding as closely as\n",
      "possible to the grave. The final services were no sooner concluded,\n",
      "however, than the object of Mr. Crupp’s unusual conduct became apparent\n",
      "to one person after another, the disclosure being made to people in the\n",
      "order of their earthly possessions. The parson was shocked at learning\n",
      "that Mr. Crupp was importuning every man of means to take stock in a\n",
      "woolen mill, to be established at Barton; but a whispered word or two\n",
      "from Crupp caused the parson to abate his displeasure, and finally to\n",
      "stand near Crupp’s side and express his own hearty approbation of the\n",
      "enterprise proposed. Then Mr. Crupp whispered a few words to Squire\n",
      "Tomple, and the Squire subscribed a hundred shares at ten dollars\n",
      "each, information of which act was disseminated among business men and\n",
      "well-to-do farmers by Parson Wedgewell with an alacrity which, had\n",
      "modern business ideas prevailed at Barton, would have laid the parson\n",
      "open to a suspicion of having accepted a few shares, to be paid for\n",
      "by his own influence. Then Deacon Jones subscribed twenty shares, and\n",
      "Judge Macdonald, Fred’s father, promised to take fifty; Crupp’s name\n",
      "already stood at the head of the list for a hundred. No stock-company\n",
      "had ever been organized at Barton before, and the citizens had always\n",
      "manifested a laudable reluctance to allow other people to handle their\n",
      "money; but this case seemed an exception to all others; confidence in\n",
      "the enterprise was so powerfully expressed, alike by the mercantile\n",
      "community, the bar, the church, and the unregenerate (the last-named\n",
      "class being represented by the ex-vender of liquors), that people who\n",
      "had any money made haste to participate in what seemed to them a race\n",
      "for wealth with the odds in everybody’s favor. Crupp neglected no one;\n",
      "he scorned no subscription on account of its smallness; before he left\n",
      "the cemetery gate nearly half the requisite capital had been pledged,\n",
      "and before he slept that night he found it necessary to accept rather\n",
      "more than the twenty thousand dollars which, it had been decided two\n",
      "days before, would be needed. Several days later a board of directors\n",
      "was elected; two or three of the directors informally offered the\n",
      "superintendency of the mill to Fred Macdonald, on condition that he\n",
      "would pledge himself to abstain from the use of intoxicating beverage\n",
      "while he held the position, and then Fred was elected superintendent in\n",
      "regular form and by unanimous vote of the board of directors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the excitement in Barton and the tributary country when\n",
      "it was announced that the mill needed no more money, and that,\n",
      "consequently, no more stock would be issued. In that mysterious way in\n",
      "which such things always happen, the secret escaped, and encountered\n",
      "every one, that his new position would prevent Fred Macdonald from\n",
      "drinking; non-stockholders had then the additional grievance that they\n",
      "had been deprived of taking any part in an enterprise for the good of\n",
      "a fellow-man, and all because the rich men of the village saw money in\n",
      "it. None of these injured ones dared to express their minds on this\n",
      "subject to Squire Tomple, to whom so many of them owed money, or to\n",
      "Judge Macdonald, who, in his family pride, would have laid himself\n",
      "liable to action by the grand jury, had any one suggested that his\n",
      "oldest son had ever been in any danger of becoming a drunkard. But\n",
      "to Mr. Crupp they did not hesitate to speak freely; Crupp owned no\n",
      "mortgages, no total abstainers owed him money; besides, he not only\n",
      "was not a church member, but he had been in that most infernal of all\n",
      "callings, rum-selling. So it came to pass that when one day Crupp\n",
      "went into Deacon Jones’s store for a dollar’s worth of sugar, and was\n",
      "awaiting his turn among a large crowd of customers, Father Baguss\n",
      "constituted himself spokesman for the aggrieved faction, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It ’pears to me, Mr. Crupp, as if reformin’ was a payin’ business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crupp being human, was not saintly, so he flushed angrily, and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _ought_ to be, if the religion you’re so fond of is worth a row of\n",
      "pins; but I don’t know what you’re driving at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! of course you don’t know,” said Father Baguss; “but everybody else\n",
      "does. You don’t expect to make any money out of that woolen mill, do\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes I do, too,” answered Crupp quickly. “I’ll make every cent I can\n",
      "out of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so,” said Father Baguss, consoling himself with a bite of\n",
      "tobacco; “an’ them that’s borne the burden and heat of the day can plod\n",
      "along and not make a cent ’xcept by the hardest knocks. I’ve been one\n",
      "of the Sons of Temperance ever since I was converted, an’ that’s nigh\n",
      "onto forty year; I don’t see why I don’t get _my_ sheer of the good\n",
      "things of this world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you mean,” said Crupp, with incomparable deliberation, “that my\n",
      "taking stock in the mill is a reward to me for dropping the liquor\n",
      "business, you’re mightily mistaken. I’d have taken it all the same if\n",
      "anybody had put me up to it when I was in the liquor business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” sighed Father Baguss, “like enough you would; as the Bible says,\n",
      "‘The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the\n",
      "children of light.’ I can’t help a-gettin’ mad, though, to think it has\n",
      "to be so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Two or three unsuccessful farmers lounging about the stove sighed\n",
      "sympathetically, but Crupp indulged in a sarcastic smile, and remarked,\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ always supposed it was because the children of light had got their\n",
      "treasure laid up in heaven, and were above such worldly notions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The late sympathizers of Father Baguss saw the joke, and laughed with\n",
      "unkind energy, upon which the good old man straightened himself and\n",
      "exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“The children of the kingdom have to earn their daily bread, I reckon;\n",
      "manna don’t fall nowadays like it used to do for the chosen people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Crupp, “and them that ain’t chosen people don’t pick\n",
      "up their dinners without working for them either, without getting into\n",
      "jail for it. But, say! I didn’t come in here to make fun of you, Father\n",
      "Baguss. If you want some of that mill stock so bad, I’ll sell you some\n",
      "of mine--that is, if you’ll go into temperance with all your might.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man seemed struck dumb for a moment but when he found his\n",
      "tongue, he made that useful member make up for lost time. “Go into\n",
      "temperance!” he shouted. “Did anybody ever hear the like of that?\n",
      "I that’s been a “Son” more’n half my life; that’s spent a hundred\n",
      "dollars--yes, more--in yearly dues; that’s been to every temperance\n",
      "meetin’ that’s ever been held in town, even when I’ve had rheumatiz so\n",
      "bad I could hardly crawl; that kept the pledge even when I was out in\n",
      "the Black Hawk War, where the doctors themselves said that I _ort_ to\n",
      "have drank; that’s plead with drinkers, and been scoffed an’ reviled\n",
      "like my blessed Master for my pains; that’s voted for the Maine Liquor\n",
      "Law; that’s been dead agin lettin’ Miles Dalling into the church\n",
      "because he brews beer for his own family drinkin’, though he’s a good\n",

      "drunkards on your soul----”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crupp, with a very white face, advanced a step or two toward the\n",
      "old man; but the participator in the Black Hawk War was not to be\n",
      "frightened, especially when he was so excited as he was now; so he\n",
      "roared,\n",
      "\n",

      "until he reached the river. Upon a raft sat a man fishing, and near by\n",

      "and galloped down the opposite bank, and Crupp, a half an hour later,\n",
      "might have been seen lying on his oars in a skiff in a shallow a mile\n",

      "\n",
      "Parson Wedgewell certainly walked very fast, and the more ground he\n",
      "covered the more rapidly his feet moved, and not his feet only. In long\n",
      "stretches of road shut in by forest trees he found himself devoid of a\n",
      "single mental restraint, and he thought aloud as he walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rebuked by a sinner! O God! with my whole heart I have sought thee,\n",
      "and thou hast instead revealed thyself not only unto babes and\n",
      "sucklings, but unto one who is certainly not like unto one of these\n",
      "little ones. Teach me thy will, for verily in written books I fear I\n",
      "have found it not. What if the boat reaches the landing before I do,\n",
      "and this lost sheep escapes me? Father in Heaven, the shepherd is\n",

      "far outside of his own parish, for most of his congregation were\n",
      "townsmen, and the old pastor knew no more of the geography of the\n",
      "country about him than he did of Chinese Tartary. He had taken what was\n",
      "known as the “River Road,” and thus far his course had been plain; now,\n",
      "however, he reached a place where the road divided, and which branch\n",

      "in sight at which he could ask his way, and, to add to his anxiety,\n",
      "the _Excellence_ came down the river to his left and rear, puffing\n",
      "and shrieking as if the making of hideous noises was the principal\n",

      "Speaking after the manner of the flesh, the Reverend Timotheus Brown\n",
      "had found only plain sailing on the river; spiritually, he had a very\n",
      "different experience. “As stubborn as a mule” was the most common\n",
      "of the current estimates of Pastor Brown’s character; and if the\n",
      "conscientious old preacher had ever personally heard this opinion of\n",
      "himself, the verbal expression thereof would have given him but slight\n",
      "annoyance, compared with that which he experienced from his own inner\n",
      "man as he paddled down the stream. To forcibly resist something so\n",
      "satisfied the strongest demand of his nature that neither shortening\n",
      "breath nor blistering hands caused him to slacken the speed with which\n",
      "he forced his paddle against the water. But another contest was going\n",
      "on, and in this the consistent theologian was not so triumphant as he\n",
      "liked always to be. Harry Wainright was one of the ungodly; that he\n",
      "owned (and frequently occupied) a high-priced pew in Mr. Brown’s own\n",
      "church was only another reason why the preacher should quote concerning\n",
      "him, “He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck----”--what if\n",
      "the conclusion of the same passage--“shall suddenly be destroyed, and\n",
      "that without remedy,” should apply? What could prevent its doing so,\n",
      "if Wainright had fulfilled the description in the first half? Had not\n",
      "the same God inspired the whole passage? If so, what right had any\n",
      "man, least of all a minister of the Gospel, to try to set at naught\n",
      "the Divine will? Harry Wainright was, according to the decrees of an\n",
      "unchangeable God, one of the lost--as much so as if he were already in\n",
      "the bottomless pit. And still the old man’s paddle flew; once on the\n",
      "trip he had felt as if the weakness of the arm of flesh would decide\n",
      "the case for him, and in favor of the Word whose expounder he was;\n",
      "he found himself wishing that it might, so that he could feel that\n",
      "although God had overruled him, he might have comfort in the assurance\n",
      "that he had not proved indifferent to his sudden emotion of yearning\n",
      "for his fellow man. But that mysterious physical readjustment, known in\n",
      "animals as “second breath,” came to the rescue of his fainting frame,\n",
      "and then it seemed as if no watery torrent could prevail against the\n",
      "force of his arm. Oh! if he might but talk to some one of the fathers\n",
      "of the church; that he might be, even for ten minutes, back in his own\n",
      "library! But no father of the church resided along the Reverend Brown’s\n",
      "nautical course, nor was there a theological library nearer than his\n",
      "own, and there he was, actually bent upon saving one whom the Eternal\n",
      "pronounced lost! Lost? Hold! “For the Son of Man is come into the\n",
      "world to save them that are lost.” If Christ had a right to save the\n",
      "lost, had not an ambassador of Christ the same privilege? was not an\n",
      "ambassador one who stood in the place--who fulfilled the duties--of an\n",
      "absent king? “Glory be to God on high!” shouted the Reverend Timotheus,\n",
      "and the dense woods echoed back “God on high!” as the old man, forty\n",
      "years a conscientious pastor, but only that instant converted to\n",
      "Christianity, drove his paddle into the water with a force that nearly\n",

      "As for Parson Wedgewell, whom we left arising from his knees after\n",
      "asking information from his Divine guide, he found himself upon the\n",

      "of half a mile brought him into a clearing, in which stood Brown’s\n",

      "and face covered with dirt deposited just after an unlucky stumble,\n",
      "come flying along the road, closely followed by Tom Adams, who was\n",

      "shouted “Horse thief!” and seized the parson, and instantly received a\n",
      "blow under the chin which rendered him inactive and despondent for the\n",
      "space of half an hour. The parson saw the gang-plank shoved out; he saw\n",
      "Harry Wainright step aboard; he saw the Rev. Timotheus jump from his\n",
      "canoe into water knee deep, dash up the plank, and throw his arm over\n",
      "Harry Wainright’s shoulder; but only a second or two elapsed before\n",
      "Parson Wedgewell monopolized the runaway’s other side, and then, as\n",
      "the three men stared at each other, neither one speaking a word, and\n",

      "exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Wainright, Mrs. Wainright is particular anxious to see you this\n",
      "evenin’, for somethin’, I don’t know what, an’ I hadn’t time to get any\n",
      "sort of a carriage for fear I’d lose the boat; but there’s good springs\n",
      "to the seat of the brick-yard wagon, an’ a new sheep-skin besides.” No\n",
      "other words coming to Tom’s mind, he abruptly walked forward muttering,\n",
      "“That’s the cock-an’-bullest yarn I ever _did_ tell; I _knew_ I\n",
      "wouldn’t know what to say.” As Tom meditated, he heard one “roustabout”\n",
      "say to another,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, Bill, you know that feller that used to sell such bully\n",
      "whiskey in Barton? Well, he’s around there on the guards, dancin’ like\n",
      "a lunatic. I shouldn’t wonder if that’s what come of swearin’ off\n",

      "\n",
      "“Mighty unsafe perceedin’,” replied Bill, eyeing Crupp suspiciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry Wainright made not the slightest objection to going back home,\n",
      "and he acted very much like a man who was glad of the company in which\n",
      "he found himself. The divine of the canoe looked at his blistered\n",
      "hands, and paid the resuscitated clerk to send the boat back by the\n",
      "first steamer. While Fred Macdonald was crossing the river, Tom Adams\n",
      "kindly drove back the road and recovered Parson Wedgewell’s coat and\n",
      "hat, and the parson accepted the hospitalities of the boat to the\n",
      "extent of water, soap, and towel. He attempted to make his peace with\n",
      "the injured clerk; but that functionary, having already interviewed\n",
      "Tom Adams, insisted that no apology was necessary, and asked the old\n",
      "gentleman in what church he preached.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the party started back, they saw, coming through a cross-road,\n",
      "a buggy violently driven, and containing two men--who proved to be\n",
      "Squire Tomple and Father Baguss--in a vehicle belonging to the latter;\n",
      "their air of having merely happened there deceived no one, least of\n",
      "all Harry Wainright himself. Father Baguss did not live in town, nor\n",
      "within four miles of it; but when Squire Tomple suggested that he\n",
      "would beg a ride back in Tom Adams’s wagon, Father Baguss objected,\n",
      "and remarked that he guessed he had business in town himself; so the\n",
      "Squire retained his seat, and Father Baguss fell in behind the wagon\n",
      "as decorously as if he was taking part in a funeral procession. Behind\n",
      "them came Fred Macdonald, who had good excuse to gallop back to the\n",
      "peculiar attraction that awaited him in Barton, but preferred to remain\n",
      "in his present company. As the party approached the town, Tom Adams\n",
      "considerately drove through the darkest and most unfrequented streets,\n",
      "and stopped as near as possible to Wainright’s house. Wainright,\n",
      "politely declining any escort, walked quietly home. Father Baguss stood\n",
      "up in his buggy, with his hand to his ear, in the original position of\n",
      "attention: suddenly he exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I heard his door shut: _now_, brethren.” And Father Baguss\n",
      "started the doxology. “Praise God from whom all blessings flow,” and\n",
      "the glorious harmonies of the old choral were proof even against\n",
      "the tremendous but discordant notes which Tom Adams, with the most\n",
      "honorable intentions, interjected in rapid succession. Then the party\n",
      "broke up. The two pastors escorted each other home alternately and\n",
      "several times in succession, during which apparently meaningless\n",
      "proceeding they learned, each from the other, how much of good intent\n",
      "had been stifled in both of them for lack of prompt application. Crupp\n",
      "and Tomple talked but little, and no “Imaginary Conversation” would\n",
      "be at all likely to reproduce what they said. Father Baguss made the\n",
      "whole air between Barton and his own farm redolent of camp-meeting\n",
      "airs, and Fred Macdonald heard in Parson Wedgewell’s parlor something\n",
      "sweeter than all the music ever written. As for Tom Adams, he jogged\n",

      "\n",
      "Here were two elements of Barton society with which Mr. Crupp had not\n",
      "been so successful as he had hoped; these were the doctors, and that\n",
      "elastic body known as “the boys.” Individually, the physicians had\n",
      "promised well at first; all of them but one were members of the Barton\n",
      "Division of the Sons of Temperance, and the Division rooms afforded\n",
      "the only floor upon which Dr. White, the allopathist, Dr. Perry, the\n",
      "homeopathist, and Dr. Pykem, the water-cure physician, ever could meet\n",
      "amicably, for they belonged to separate churches. Old Dr. Matthews,\n",
      "who had retired from practice, was not a “Son,” only because he was a\n",
      "conscientious opponent of secret societies; but he had signed every\n",
      "public pledge ever circulated in Barton, and he had never drunk a\n",
      "drop of liquor in his life. All the physicians freely admitted to Mr.\n",
      "Crupp that alcohol was a never-failing cause of disease, or at least\n",
      "of physical deterioration; all declared that no class of maladies\n",
      "were so incurable, and so depressing to the spirits of the medical\n",
      "practitioner, as those to which habitual drinkers, even those who\n",
      "were never drunk, were subject; but--they really did not see what\n",
      "more they, the physicians of Barton, could do than they were already\n",
      "doing. Crupp discussed the matter with Parson Wedgewell, and the parson\n",
      "volunteered to preach a sermon to physicians from the text, “Give\n",
      "wine unto those that be of heavy hearts,” a text which had suggested\n",
      "itself to him, or, rather, had been providentially suggested to him\n",
      "on the occasion of his very first interview with Crupp, and which was\n",
      "outlined in his mind in a manner suggestive of delightful subtleties\n",
      "and a startling application. But when Crupp sounded the doctors as to\n",
      "whether such a discourse would be agreeable, Dr. White said he would\n",
      "be glad to listen to the eloquent divine; but he was conscientiously\n",
      "opposed to appearing, even by the faintest implication, to admit that\n",
      "the homeopathist was a physician at all. Dr. Perry felt his need, as a\n",
      "partaker in the fall of Adam, to being preached to from any portion of\n",
      "the inspired Word; but he could not sit in an audience to which such\n",
      "a humbug as Pykem could be admitted in an official capacity; while\n",
      "Dr. Pykem said that he would rejoice to encourage the preacher by his\n",
      "presence, if he thought any amount of preaching would do any good\n",
      "to a remorseless slaughterer like White, or an idiotic old potterer\n",
      "like Perry. Then Mr. Crupp tried another plan: he himself organized\n",
      "a meeting in which the exercises were to consist of short addresses\n",
      "upon the physical bearing of intemperance, the addresses to be made\n",
      "by “certain of our fellow-citizens who have had many opportunities\n",
      "for special observation in this direction.” Even then Drs. White and\n",
      "Perry objected to sitting on the same platform with Dr. Pykem, who had\n",
      "never attended any medical school of any sort, and who would probably\n",
      "say something utterly ridiculous in support of his own senseless\n",
      "theories, and thus spoil the effect of the physiological facts and\n",
      "deductions which Drs. Perry and White each admitted that the other\n",
      "might be intellectually capable of advancing. Crupp arranged the matter\n",
      "amicably, however, by having Pykem make the first address, during\n",
      "which the other two physicians were to occupy back seats, where they\n",
      "might, while unobserved, take notes of such of Pykem’s heresies as\n",
      "they might deem it necessary to combat: he further arranged that,\n",
      "immediately after Pykem had concluded, he was to be called away to a\n",
      "patient, provided for the occasion. Still more--and great would have\n",
      "been the disgust of White and Perry had they known of it--Crupp laid so\n",
      "plainly before Pykem the necessities of the community, and the duty,\n",
      "not only Christian, but of the simplest manliness, also, that men of\n",
      "any intelligence owed to their fellow-men, that Pykem, who with all\n",
      "his hobbies was a man of Christian belief and humane heart, confined\n",
      "himself solely to the preventive efficacy of external applications\n",
      "of water, not unmixed with soap, in the case of persons who felt\n",
      "toward alcohol a craving which they could not logically explain; he\n",
      "thus delivered an address which might, with cause, be repeated in\n",
      "every community in the United States. Then Dr. Perry, whose forte was\n",
      "experimental physiology, read whole tables of statistics based upon\n",
      "systematic observations; and Dr. White unrolled and explained some\n",
      "charts and plates of various internal organs, naturally unhandsome\n",
      "in themselves, which had been injured by alcohol. It was declared by\n",
      "close observers that for a few days after this meeting the demand for\n",
      "sponges and toilet soap exceeded the experience of the old and single\n",
      "apothecary of the village, and that liquor-sellers looked either sober\n",
      "or savage, according to their respective natures.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the boys! Crupp found himself in time really disposed to ask\n",
      "Pastors Wedgewell and Brown whether there wasn’t Scriptural warrant for\n",
      "the supposition that Job obtained his sons by marrying a widow with a\n",
      "grown-up family. “The boys” numbered about a hundred specimens, ranging\n",
      "in age from fourteen years to forty; no two were alike in disposition,\n",
      "as Crupp had long known; they came from all sorts of peculiar social\n",
      "conditions that warred against their physical and moral well-being;\n",
      "some of them seemed wholly corrupt, and bent upon corrupting others;\n",
      "many more exhibited a faculty for promising which could be matched in\n",
      "magnitude only by their infirmity of performance. By a vigorous course\n",
      "of individual exhortation, the burden of which was that everybody knew\n",
      "they drank because they were too cowardly to refuse, and that nobody\n",
      "despised them so heartily as the very men who sold them the rum,\n",
      "Crupp lessened the number of drinking boys by about one-fourth, thus\n",
      "rescuing those who were easiest to save and most worth saving, but the\n",
      "remainder made as much trouble as the collective body had done. Crupp\n",
      "scolded, pleaded, and argued; he hired some boys to drop liquor for at\n",
      "least a stated time; he importuned some of the more refined citizens\n",
      "to interest themselves socially in certain boys; he lent some of these\n",
      "boys money with which to buy clothing which would bring their personal\n",
      "appearance up to the Barton standard of respectability, and he covertly\n",
      "excited some of the merchants up to a genuine interest in certain boys,\n",
      "by persuading them to sell to said boys coats, boots, and hats on\n",
      "credits nominally short.\n",
      "\n",
      "He enjoyed the hearty co-operation of the village pastors, all of\n",
      "whom preached sermons to young men and to parents; but his principal\n",
      "practical assistance came, quite unexpectedly, from old Bunley. Bunley\n",
      "had not yet succeeded in finding anything to do, and, as he had on his\n",
      "hands all of his time which was not needed at the family woodpile,\n",
      "he went around talking to the boys. Bunley had been, according to\n",
      "the Barton classification, a “boy” himself; he had drunk in a not\n",
      "remote day with any boy who invited him; he knew more jolly songs\n",
      "than any other half dozen inebriates in the village, and was simply\n",
      "oppressed with the load of good (bad) stories which he never tired of\n",
      "telling; he had been always ready to play cards with any boy, and\n",
      "had come to be regarded, among the youngsters, as “the best fellow\n",
      "in the village.” Now that he had reformed, his success in reforming\n",
      "boys was simply remarkable--so much so that Parson Wedgewell began to\n",
      "tremble over the thought that Bunley, by the present results of the\n",
      "experience of his sinful days, might demonstrate, beyond the hope of\n",
      "refutation, the dreadful proposition that it was better that a man\n",
      "should be a sinner in his youth, so as to know how to be a saint when\n",
      "he became old. This idea Parson Wedgewell laid, with much trepidation,\n",
      "before the Reverend Timotheus Brown, and the two old saints and new\n",
      "friends had a delightfully doleful time on their knees over it, until\n",
      "there occurred to the Reverend Timotheus Brown a principle which he\n",
      "proceeded to formulate as follows: The greater the capacity of a\n",
      "misguided faculty for evil, the greater the good the same faculty may\n",
      "accomplish when in its normal condition. To be sure, the discovery was\n",
      "not original with him; the same statement had been made by peripatetic\n",
      "phrenologists at Barton; indeed, it was visible, to one who could read\n",
      "rather than merely repeat words, in every chapter of the Bible so dear\n",
      "to this good old man; but the illusion under which Parson Brown was\n",
      "allowed to labor worked powerfully for his own good and for that of\n",
      "the community, for from that time forth both he and Parson Wedgewell\n",
      "displayed their greatest earnestness in work with cases apparently the\n",
      "most hopeless. These they found among “the boys,” and harder work no\n",
      "reformer ever laid out for himself. The ingenuity, the persistence,\n",
      "the determined brutality of some of the boys, the logical acuteness\n",
      "displayed in varied fits of deception, only stimulated the old man\n",
      "to greater industry, and slowly, after hard work, often after work\n",
      "that seemed more like hard fighting, but yet surely, Parson Brown\n",
      "reformed one after another of several hard cases. The villagers,\n",
      "most of whom considered that their whole duty consisted in critical\n",
      "observation, applauded handsomely, and Bunley was astonished, and felt\n",
      "considerably mortified at the marked success of his new rival, while\n",
      "Parson Wedgewell found it necessary to pray earnestly that unchristian\n",
      "jealousy might be banished from his own mind. But to Parson Brown\n",
      "the greatest triumph occurred when Crupp--Crupp, the literalist,\n",
      "the hard-headed, the man who trusted in the arm of flesh, the man\n",
      "of action, he who slightingly received any suggestions of special\n",
      "thank-offerings of prayer for special services received--Crupp came to\n",
      "him by night--it reminded Parson Brown of Nicodemus--and exclaimed,\n",
      "“It’s no use, Parson; I’ve done my best on Frank Pughger, but he’s a\n",

      "the shades of night. The old man was out of bed at his usual hour, and\n",
      "he took his spiritual songs to the barn with him, to the astonishment\n",
      "of his mild-eyed cows and quick-eared horses; and when his drove of\n",
      "porkers demanded their morning meal with the vocal power peculiar to\n",

      "_so_ happy that his single hired man could not resist the temptation\n",
      "of asking for an increase of pay; but the sobriety to which this\n",
      "interruption and its consequent refusal reduced Father Baguss was of\n",
      "only temporary duration, and the broken strain was resumed with renewed\n",
      "energy. The ecstasy lasted into and through the old man’s matutinal\n",
      "repast, and manifested itself by an occasional hum through the good\n",
      "man’s nose, which did the duty ordinarily performed by a mouth which\n",
      "was now busied about other things; it caused Father Baguss to read a\n",
      "glorious psalm as he officiated at the family altar after breakfast; it\n",
      "made itself felt half way through the set prayer which the old farmer\n",

      "depart as its whilom possessor uttered the petition, “May we impart to\n",
      "others of the grace with which thou hast visited us so abundantly.”\n",

      "stared out of the window, walked up and down the kitchen with his hands\n",
      "in his pockets, lit a pipe, relit it half a dozen times at two minute\n",
      "intervals, sighed, groaned, and at length strode across the room like a\n",
      "bandit coming upon the boards of a theater, seized his hat, and started\n",
      "for the Tappelmine domicile.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he plodded along over the rough road, he had two very distinct\n",
      "ideas in his mind: one was, that he hadn’t the slightest notion of\n",
      "what to say to Tappelmine; the other, and stronger, was, that it would\n",
      "be a relief to him to discover that Tappelmine was away from home,\n",
      "or even sick in bed--yes, or even drunk. But this hope was of very\n",
      "short duration, for soon the old man heard the Tappelmine axe, and,\n",
      "as he rounded the corner of the miserable house, he saw Tappelmine\n",
      "himself--a tall, gaunt figure in faded homespun, torn straw hat, and a\n",
      "tangled thicket of muddy-gray hair. The face which Tappelmine turned,\n",
      "as he heard the approaching footsteps, was not one to warm the heart\n",
      "of a man inspired only by an unwelcome sense of duty; it was thin,\n",
      "full of vagrant wrinkles; the nose had apparently started in different\n",
      "directions, and each time failed to return to its original line; the\n",
      "eyes were watery and colorless, and the lips were thin and drawn into\n",
      "the form of a jagged volcano crater.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The idee of doin’ anything for such!” exclaimed Father Baguss under\n",
      "his breath. “O Lord! _you_ put me up to this here job--unless it was\n",

      "\n",
      "“How’d your crop turn out?” asked Father Baguss, well knowing that\n",
      "“crop” was a terribly sarcastic word to apply to the acre or two of\n",
      "badly cultivated corn which Tappelmine had planted, but yet feeling a\n",
      "frantic need of talking against time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, not over’n above good,” said Tappelmine, as impervious to the\n",

      "glass of whiskey. “I dunno what would have ’come of us ef I hadn’t\n",

      "“You might have given a hint to your neighbors, if worst had come to\n",

      "“Nobody’d have stood by an’ seen you starve.”\n",
      "\n",

      "starting two or three large chips in quick succession.\n",

      "care not to look into his neighbor’s eye, “I used to borry a little\n",
      "somethin’--corn, mebbe, or a piece of meat once in a while; but folks\n",

      "continued to look sullen, and Father Baguss, finding the silence\n",
      "insupportably annoying, said rather more than he had intended to say.\n",
      "There are natures which, while containing noble qualities, are most\n",
      "awkward expositors of themselves, and that of Baguss was one of this\n",
      "sort. Such people are given to action which is open to criticism on\n",
      "every side; yet, in spite of their awkwardnesses, they find in their\n",

      "humanity; but--perhaps for his own good--he was unconscious of his\n",
      "strength and painfully observant of his weakness. Yet he continued as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, Tappelmine, I came over here on purpose to find out if I\n",
      "could do anything to help you get into better habits. You don’t amount\n",
      "to a row of pins as things are now, and I don’t like it; it’s throwed\n",
      "up to me, because I’m your neighbor, and there’s folks that stick to it\n",
      "that _I’m_ to blame. I don’t see how; but if there’s any cross layin’\n",
      "around that fits my shoulders, I s’pose I ought to pick it up an’ pack\n",
      "it along. Now, why in creation don’t you give up drinkin,’ an’ go to\n",
      "church, an’ make a crop, an’ do other things like decent folks do?\n",
      "You’re bigger’n I am, an’ stouter, an’ your farm’s as good as mine if\n",
      "you’d only work it. Now why you don’t do it, I don’t see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t, eh?” snarled Tappelmine, dropping his axe, and leaning against\n",
      "the house with folded hands. “Well, ’cause I hain’t got any plow, nor\n",
      "any harrow, nor but one hoss, nor rails enough to keep out cattle, nor\n",
      "seed-corn or wheat, nor money to buy it with, nor anything to live on\n",
      "until the crop’s made, nor anything to prevent the crop when it’s made\n",
      "from being grabbed by whoever I owe money to; _that’s_ why I don’t\n",
      "make a crop. An’ I don’t go to church, ’cause I hain’t got any clothes\n",
      "excep’ these ’uns that I’ve got on, an’ my wife’s as bad off as _I_ be.\n",
      "An’ I don’t give up drinkin’, ’cause drinkin’ makes me feel good, an’\n",
      "the only folks I know that care anything for me drink too. You fellers\n",
      "that only drink on the sly----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never touched a drop in all my life!” roared Father Baguss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right,” said Tappelmine; “stick to it; there’s some that’ll\n",
      "believe that yarn. But what I was goin’ to say was, folks that drink on\n",
      "the sly know it’s comfortin’, an’ I don’t see what they go a-pokin’ up\n",
      "fellers that does it fair an’ square for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Father Baguss groaned, and some influence--the old man in later days\n",
      "laid it upon the arch-enemy of souls--suggested to him the foolishness\n",
      "of having gone into so great an operation without first counting\n",
      "the cost; hadn’t the great Founder of the old man’s religious faith\n",
      "enjoined a counting of the cost of any enterprise before entering upon\n",
      "it? Father Baguss wished _that_ chapter of Holy Writ might have met\n",
      "his eye that morning at the family altar; but it had not, and, worse\n",
      "yet, Tappelmine was becoming wide awake and excited. It was not what\n",
      "the drunkard had said about drinking or church-going that troubled this\n",
      "would-be reformer; Tappelmine’s outline of his material condition was\n",
      "what annoyed Father Baguss; for, in spite of an occasional attempt to\n",
      "mentally allay his fears by falling back upon prayer, the incentive\n",
      "with which he had called upon Tappelmine had taken strong hold of\n",
      "his conscience, and persisted in making its influence felt. Plows\n",
      "and prayers, harrows and hopes, seed-corn and the seed sown by the\n",
      "wayside mixed themselves inextricably in his mind, as parallels often\n",
      "do when men dream, or when they are confronted by an emergency beyond\n",
      "the control of their own intellects. The old man prayed silently and\n",
      "earnestly for relief, and his prayer was answered in a manner not\n",
      "entirely according to his liking, for he felt moved to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’ll_ lend you seed, if you’ll go to work an’ put it right in, an’\n",
      "I’ll lend you a plow and a team to break up the ground with--I mean,\n",
      "I’ll hire ’em to you, an’ agree to buy your crop at rulin’ price, an’\n",
      "pay you the difference in cash.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That sounds somethin’ like,” remarked Tappelmine, thrusting his\n",
      "hands into his trowsers’ pockets, and making other preparations for a\n",
      "business talk; “but,” he continued, “what am I to live on along till\n",
      "harvest? ’Tain’t even winter yet.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“The Lord knows,” answered the never-do-well, with unimpeachable\n",
      "veracity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” said the old farmer, “I guess he knows what you’ll do in\n",
      "t’other case. You can work, I reckon. _I_ hain’t got much to do, but\n",
      "you can do it, at whatever prices is goin’, an’ that’ll help you get\n",
      "work of other folks; nobody can say I get stuck on the men I hire. So\n",
      "they’re generally glad enough to hire ’em themselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tappelmine did not seem overjoyed at his prospects, but he had the\n",
      "grace to say that they were better than he had expected. Father Baguss\n",
      "went home, feeling but little more comfortable than when he had\n",
      "started on his well-intended mission. Tappelmine sauntered into his own\n",
      "cabin, wondering how much of the promised seed-corn and wheat he could\n",
      "smuggle into town and trade for whiskey; but he was rather surprised to\n",
      "have his wife, a short, thin, sallow, uninteresting-looking woman, who\n",
      "had been listening at the broken window, approach him, throw her arms\n",
      "about his neck, and exclaim,\n",
      "\n",

      "The surprise was too great for Tappelmine, and he spent the remainder\n",
      "of the day in nursing his knee on the single hearthstone of his\n",
      "mansion. He was not undisturbed, however, and as men of his mental\n",
      "caliber hate persistent reason even worse than they do work, Mrs.\n",
      "Tappelmine not only coaxed her lord into resolving to be respectable,\n",

      "\n",
      "A PHENOMENON IN EMBRYO.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The superintendency of the Mississippi Valley Woolen Mills was a\n",
      "position which exactly suited Fred Macdonald, and it gave him occasion\n",
      "for the expenditure of whatever superfluous energy he found himself\n",
      "possessed of, yet it did not engross his entire attention. The faculty\n",
      "which the busiest of young men have for finding time in which to\n",
      "present themselves, well clothed and unbusiness-like, to at least one\n",
      "young woman, is as remarkable and admirable as it is inexplicable. The\n",
      "evenings which did not find Fred in Parson Wedgewell’s parlor were\n",
      "few indeed, and if, when he was with Esther, he did not talk quite as\n",
      "sentimentally as he had done in the earlier days of his engagement,\n",
      "and if he talked business very frequently, the change did not seem\n",
      "distasteful to the lady herself. For the business of which he talked\n",
      "was, in the main, of a sort which loving women have for ages recognized\n",
      "as the inevitable, and to which they have subjected themselves with\n",
      "a unanimity which deserves the gratitude of all humanity. Fred talked\n",
      "of a cottage which he might enter without first knocking at the door,\n",
      "and of a partnership which should be unlimited; if he learned, in the\n",
      "course of successive conversations, that even in partnerships of the\n",
      "most extreme order many compromises are absolutely necessary, the\n",
      "lesson was one which improved his character in the ratio in which it\n",
      "abased his pride. The cottage grew as rapidly as the mill, and on\n",
      "his returns from various trips for machinery there came with Fred’s\n",
      "freight certain packages which prevented their owner from appearing\n",
      "so completely the absorbed business man which he flattered himself\n",
      "that he seemed. Then the partnership was formed one evening in Parson\n",
      "Wedgewell’s own church, in the presence of a host of witnesses,\n",
      "Fred appearing as self-satisfied and radiant as the gainer in such\n",
      "transactions always does, while Esther’s noble face and drooping eyes\n",
      "showed beyond doubt who it was that was the giver.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the weeks succeeded each other after the wedding, however, no\n",
      "acquaintance of the couple could wonder whether the gainer or the giver\n",
      "was the happier. Fred improved rapidly, as the school-boy improves;\n",
      "but Esther’s graces were already of mature growth, and rejoiced in\n",
      "their opportunity for development. Though she could not have explained\n",
      "how it happened, she could not but notice that maidens regarded her\n",
      "wonderingly, wives contemplated her wistfully, frowns departed and\n",
      "smiles appeared when she approached people who were usually considered\n",
      "prosaic. Yet shadows sometimes stole over her face, when she looked at\n",
      "certain of her old acquaintances, and the cause thereof soon took a\n",
      "development which was anything but pleasing to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred,” said Esther one evening, “it makes me real unhappy sometimes to\n",
      "think of the good wives there are who are not as happy as I am. I think\n",
      "of Mrs. Moshier and Mrs. Crayme, and the only reason that I can see is,\n",
      "their husbands drink.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guess you’re right, Ettie,” said Fred. “They didn’t begin their\n",
      "domestic tyranny in advance, as _you_ did--bless you for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why _don’t_ their husbands stop?” asked Esther, too deeply\n",
      "interested in her subject to notice her husband’s compliment. “They\n",
      "must see what they’re doing, and how cruel it all is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re too far gone to stop; I suppose that’s the reason,” said\n",
      "Fred. “It hasn’t been easy work for _me_ to keep my promise, Ettie, and\n",
      "I’m a young man; Moshier and Crayme are middle-aged men, and liquor is\n",
      "simply necessary to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That dreadful old Bunley wasn’t too old to reform, it seems,” said\n",
      "Esther. “Fred, I believe one reason is that no one has asked them to\n",
      "stop. See how good Harry Wainright has been since he found that so many\n",
      "people were interested in him that day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye----es,” drawled Fred, evidently with a suspicion of what was\n",
      "coming, and trying to change the subject by suddenly burying himself in\n",
      "his memorandum book. But this ruse did not succeed, for Esther crossed\n",
      "the room to where Fred sat, placed her hands on his shoulders, and a\n",
      "kiss on his forehead, and exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred, _you’re_ the proper person to reform those two men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Ettie,” groaned Fred, “you’re entirely mistaken. Why, they’d laugh\n",
      "right in my face, if they didn’t get angry and knock me down. Reformers\n",
      "want to be older men, better men, men like your father, for instance,\n",
      "if people are to listen to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father says they need to be men who understand the nature of those\n",
      "they are talking to,” replied Esther; “and you once told me that you\n",
      "understood Moshier and Crayme perfectly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But just think of what they are, Ettie,” pleaded Fred. “Moshier is a\n",
      "contractor, and Crayme’s a steamboat captain; _such_ men never reform,\n",
      "though they always are good fellows. Why, if I were to speak to either\n",
      "of them on the subject, they’d laugh in my face, or curse me. The only\n",
      "way I was able to make peace with them for stopping drinking myself was\n",
      "to say that I did it to please my wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did they accept that as sufficient excuse?” asked Esther.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Fred reluctantly, and biting his lips over this slip of his\n",
      "tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you’ve set them a good example, and I can’t believe its effect\n",
      "will be lost,” said Esther.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sincerely hope it won’t,” said Fred, very willing to seem a reformer\n",
      "at heart; “nobody would be gladder than I to see those fellows with\n",
      "wives as happy as mine seems to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why don’t you follow it up, Fred, dear, and make sure of your\n",
      "hopes being realized? You can’t imagine how much happier _I_ would be\n",
      "if I could meet those dear women without feeling that I had to hide\n",
      "the joy that’s so hard to keep to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation continued with considerable strain to Fred’s\n",
      "amiability; but his sophistry was no match for his wife’s earnestness,\n",
      "and he was finally compelled to promise that he would make an appeal\n",
      "to Crayme, with whom he had a business engagement, on the arrival of\n",
      "Crayme’s boat, the _Excellence_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the whistles of the steamer were next heard, however, Esther\n",
      "learned something of the sufferings of would-be reformers, and found\n",
      "cause to wonder who was to endure most that Mrs. Crayme should have a\n",
      "sober husband, for Fred was alternately cross, moody, abstracted, and\n",
      "inattentive, and even sullenly remarked at his breakfast-table one\n",
      "morning that he shouldn’t be sorry if the _Excellence_ were to blow\n",
      "up, and leave Mrs. Crayme to find her happiness in widowhood. But no\n",
      "such luck befell the lady: the whistle-signals of the _Excellence_ were\n",
      "again heard in the river, and the nature of Fred’s business with the\n",
      "captain made it unadvisable for Fred to make an excuse for leaving the\n",
      "boat unvisited.\n",
      "\n",
      "It _did_ seem to Fred Macdonald as if everything conspired to make\n",
      "his task as hard as it could possibly be. Crayme was already under the\n",
      "influence of more liquor than was necessary to his well-being, and the\n",
      "boat carried as passengers a couple of men, who, though professional\n",
      "gamblers, Crayme found very jolly company when they were not engaged\n",
      "in their business calling. Besides, Captain Crayme was running against\n",
      "time with an opposition boat which had just been put upon the river,\n",
      "and he appreciated the necessity of having the boat’s bar well stocked\n",
      "and freely opened to whoever along the river was influential in\n",
      "making or marring the reputation of steamboats. Fred finally got the\n",
      "captain into his own room, however, and made a freight contract so\n",
      "absent-mindedly that the sagacious captain gained an immense advantage\n",
      "over him; then he acted so awkwardly, and looked so pale, that the\n",
      "captain suggested chills, and prescribed brandy. Fred smiled feebly,\n",
      "and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you, Sam; brandy’s at the bottom of the trouble. I”--here\n",
      "Fred made a tremendous attempt to rally himself--“I want _you_ to swear\n",
      "off, Sam.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The astonishment of Captain Crayme was marked enough to be alarming\n",
      "at first; then the ludicrous feature of Fred’s request struck him\n",
      "so forcibly that he burst into a laugh before whose greatness Fred\n",
      "trembled and shrank.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, by thunder!” exclaimed the captain, when he recovered his\n",
      "breath; “if that isn’t the best thing I ever heard yet! The idea of\n",
      "a steamboat captain swearing off his whiskey! Say, Fred, don’t you\n",
      "want me to join the church? I forgot that you’d married a preacher’s\n",
      "daughter, or I wouldn’t have been so puzzled over your white face\n",
      "to-day. Sam Crayme brought down to cold water! Wouldn’t the boys along\n",
      "the river get up a sweet lot of names for me--the ‘Cold-water Captain,’\n",
      "‘Psalm-singing Sammy’! and then, when an editor or any other visitor\n",
      "came aboard, _wouldn’t_ I look the thing, hauling out glasses and a\n",
      "pitcher of water! Say, Fred, does your wife let you drink tea and\n",
      "coffee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sam!” exclaimed Fred, springing to his feet, “if you don’t stop\n",
      "slanting at my wife, I’ll knock you down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the captain, without exhibiting any signs of trepidation.\n",
      "“_Now_ you talk like yourself again. I beg your pardon, old fellow; you\n",
      "know I was only joking, but it _is_ too funny. You’ll have to take a\n",
      "trip or two with me again, though, and be reformed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not any,” said Fred, resuming his chair; “take your wife along, and\n",
      "reform yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here, now, young man,” said the captain, “_you’re_ cracking on\n",
      "too much steam. Honestly, Fred, I’ve kept a sharp eye on you for two or\n",
      "three months, and I am right glad you can let whiskey alone. I’ve seen\n",
      "times when I wished I were in your boots; but steamboats can’t be run\n",
      "without liquor, however it may be with woolen mills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all nonsense,” said Fred. “You get trade because you run your\n",
      "boat on time, charge fair prices, and deliver your freight in good\n",
      "order. Who gives you business because you drink and treat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain, being unable to recall any shipper of the class alluded to\n",
      "by Fred, changed his course.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tisn’t so much that,” said he; “it’s a question of reputation. How\n",
      "would I feel to go ashore at Pittsburg or Louisville or Cincinnati, and\n",
      "refuse to drink with anybody? Why, ’twould ruin me. It’s different with\n",
      "you who don’t have to meet anybody but religious old farmers. Besides,\n",
      "you’ve just been married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you’ve been married for five years,” said Fred, with a sudden\n",
      "sense of help at hand. “How do you suppose _your_ wife feels?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Crayme’s jollity subsided a little, but with only a little\n",
      "hesitation he replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! she’s used to it; she doesn’t mind it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re the only person in town that thinks so, Sam,” said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Captain Crayme got up and paced his little state-room two or three\n",
      "times, with a face full of uncertainty. At last he replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, between old friends, Fred, I don’t think so very strongly\n",
      "myself. Hang it! I wish I’d been brought up a preacher, or something of\n",
      "the kind, so I wouldn’t have had business ruining my chances of being\n",
      "the right sort of a family man. Emily _don’t_ like my drinking, and\n",
      "I’ve promised to look up some other business; but ’tisn’t easy to get\n",
      "out of steamboating when you’ve got a good boat and a first-rate trade.\n",
      "Once she felt so awfully about it that I _did_ swear off--don’t tell\n",
      "anybody, for God’s sake! but I did. I had to look out for my character\n",
      "along the river, though; so I swore off on the sly, and played sick.\n",
      "I’d give my orders to the mates and clerks from my bed in here, and\n",
      "then I’d lock myself in, and read novels and the Bible to keep from\n",
      "thinking. ’Twas awful dry work all around; but ‘whole hog or none’ is\n",
      "_my_ style, you know. There was fun in it, though, to think of doing\n",
      "something that no other captain on the river ever did. But, thunder!\n",
      "by the time night came, I was so tired of loafing that I wrapped a\n",
      "blanket around my head and shoulders, like a Hoosier, sneaked out the\n",
      "outer door here, and walked the guards, between towns; but I was so\n",
      "frightened for fear some one would know me that the walk did me more\n",
      "harm than good. And blue! why a whole cargo of indigo would have looked\n",
      "like a snow-storm alongside of my feelings the second day; ’pon my\n",
      "word, Fred, I caught myself crying in the afternoon, just before dark,\n",
      "and I couldn’t find out what for either. I tell _you_, I was scared,\n",
      "and things got worse as time spun along; the dreams I had that night\n",
      "made me howl, and I felt worse yet when daylight came along again.\n",
      "Toward the next night I was just afraid to go to sleep; so I made up\n",
      "my mind to get well, go on duty, and dodge everybody that it seemed\n",
      "I ought to drink with. Why, the Lord bless your soul! the first time\n",
      "we shoved off from a town, I walked up to the bar, just as I always\n",
      "did after leaving towns; the barkeeper set out my particular bottle\n",
      "naturally enough, knowing nothing about my little game; I poured my\n",
      "couple of fingers, and dropped it down as innocent as a lamb before\n",
      "I knew what I was doing. By George! my boy, ’twas like opening\n",
      "lock-gates; I was just heavenly gay before morning. There was one good\n",
      "thing about it, though--I never told Emily I was going to swear off; I\n",
      "was going to surprise her, so I had the disappointment all to myself.\n",
      "Maybe she isn’t as happy as your wife; but, whatever else I’ve done, or\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s a pity you hadn’t promised _her_ then, before you tried your\n",
      "experiment,” said Fred. The captain shook his head gravely and replied,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guess not; why, I’d have either killed somebody or killed myself if\n",
      "I’d gone on a day or two longer. I s’pose I’d have got along better\n",
      "if I’d had anybody to keep me company, or reason with me like a\n",
      "schoolmaster; but I hadn’t; I didn’t know anybody that I dared trust\n",
      "with a secret like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ hadn’t reformed then, eh?” queried Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You? why you’re one of the very fellows I dodged! Just as I got aboard\n",
      "the boat--I came down late, on purpose--I saw you out aft. I tell\n",
      "you, I was under my blankets, with a towel wrapped around my jaw, in\n",
      "about one minute, and was just _a-praying_ that you hadn’t seen me come\n",
      "aboard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred laughed, but his laughter soon made place for a look of tender\n",
      "solicitude. The unexpected turn that had been reached in the\n",
      "conversation he had so dreaded, and the sympathy which had been\n",
      "awakened in him by Crayme’s confidence and openness, temporarily made\n",
      "of Fred Macdonald a man with whom Fred himself had never before been\n",
      "acquainted. A sudden idea struck him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sam,” said he, “try it over again, and _I’ll_ stay by you. I’ll nurse\n",
      "you, crack jokes, fight off the blues for you, keep your friends away.\n",
      "I’ll even break your neck for you, if you like, seeing it’s you if\n",
      "it’ll keep you straight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you, though?” said the captain, with a look of admiration\n",
      "undisguised, except by wonder. “You’re the first friend I ever had,\n",
      "then. By thunder! how marrying Ettie Wedgewell _did_ improve you, Fred!\n",
      "But,” and the captain’s face lengthened again, “there’s a fellow’s\n",
      "reputation to be considered, and where’ll mine be after it gets around\n",
      "that I’ve sworn off?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reputation be hanged!” exclaimed Fred. “_Lose_ it, for your wife’s\n",
      "sake. Besides, you’ll _make_ reputation instead of lose it: you’ll be\n",
      "as famous as the Red River Raft, or the Mammoth Cave--the only thing of\n",
      "the kind west of the Alleghanies. As for the boys, tell them I’ve bet\n",
      "you a hundred that you can’t stay off your liquor for a year, and that\n",
      "you’re not the man to take a dare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ sounds like business,” exclaimed the captain, springing to his\n",
      "feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me draw up a pledge,” said Fred eagerly, drawing pen and ink\n",
      "toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you don’t, my boy,” said the captain gently, and pushing Fred\n",
      "out of the room and upon the guards. “Emily shall do that. Below\n",
      "there!--Perkins, I’ve got to go up town for an hour; see if you can’t\n",
      "pick up freight to pay laying-up expenses somehow. Fred, go home and\n",
      "get your traps; ‘now’s the accepted time,’ as your father-in-law has\n",

      "As Sam Crayme strode toward the body of the town, his business\n",
      "instincts took strong hold of his sentiments, in the manner natural\n",
      "alike to saints and sinners, and he laid a plan of operations against\n",
      "whiskey which was characterized by the apparent recklessness but actual\n",
      "prudence which makes for glory in steamboat captains, as it does in\n",
      "army commanders. As was his custom in business, he first drove at\n",
      "full speed upon the greatest obstacles; so it came to pass that he\n",
      "burst into his own house, threw his arm around his wife with more than\n",
      "ordinary tenderness, and then looking into her eyes with the daring\n",
      "born of utter desperation, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emily, I came back to sign the strongest temperance pledge that you\n",
      "can possibly draw up; Fred Macdonald wanted to write out one, but I\n",
      "told him that nobody but you should do it; you’ve earned the right to,\n",
      "poor girl.” No such duty and surprise having ever before come hand\n",
      "in hand to Mrs. Crayme, she acted as every true woman will imagine\n",
      "that she herself would have done under similar circumstances, and this\n",
      "action made it not so easy as it might otherwise have been to see just\n",
      "where the pen and ink were, or to prevent the precious document, when\n",
      "completed, from being disfigured by peculiar blots which were neither\n",
      "finger-marks nor ink-spots, yet which in shape and size suggested both\n",
      "of these indications of unneatness. Mrs. Crayme was not an adept at\n",
      "literary composition, and, being conscious of her own deficiencies, she\n",
      "begged that a verbal pledge might be substituted; but her husband was\n",
      "firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A contract don’t steer worth a cent unless it’s in writing, Emily,”\n",
      "said he, looking over his wife’s shoulder as she wrote. “Gracious,\n",
      "girl, you’re making it too thin; _any_ greenhorn could sail right\n",
      "through that and all around it. Here, let _me_ have it.” And Crayme\n",
      "wrote, dictating aloud to himself as he did so, “And the--party--of the\n",
      "first part--hereby agrees to--do everything--else that the--spirit of\n",
      "this--agreement--seems to the party--of the second--part to--indicate\n",
      "or--imply.” This he read over to his wife, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the way we fix contracts that aren’t ship-shape, Emily; a\n",
      "steamboat couldn’t be run in any other way.” Then Crayme wrote at the\n",
      "foot of the paper, “Sam. Crayme, Capt. Str. _Excellence_,” surveyed the\n",
      "document with evident pride, and handed it to his wife, saying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, you see, you’ve got me so I can’t ever get out of it by trying to\n",
      "make out that ’twas some other Sam Crayme that you reformed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O husband!” said Mrs. Crayme, throwing her arms about the captain’s\n",
      "neck, “_don’t_ talk in that dreadful business way! I’m too happy to\n",
      "bear it. I want to go with you on this trip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain shrank away from his wife’s arms, and a cold perspiration\n",
      "started all over him as he exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t, little girl! Wait till next trip. There’s an unpleasant set\n",
      "of passengers aboard; the barometer points to rainy weather, so you’d\n",
      "have to stay in the cabin all the time; our cook is sick, and his cubs\n",
      "serve up the most infernal messes; we’re light of freight, and have got\n",
      "to stop at every warehouse on the river, and the old boat’ll be either\n",
      "shrieking, or bumping, or blowing off steam the whole continual time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Crayme’s happiness had been frightening some of her years away,\n",
      "and her smile carried Sam himself back to his pre-marital period as she\n",
      "said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind the rest; I see you don’t want me to go,” and then she\n",
      "became Mrs. Crayme again as she said, pressing her face closely to her\n",
      "husband’s breast, “but I hope you won’t get _any_ freight, _anywhere_,\n",
      "so you can get home all the sooner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the captain called on Dr. White, and announced such a collection\n",
      "of symptoms that the doctor grew alarmed, insisted on absolute quiet,\n",
      "conveyed Crayme in his own carriage to the boat, saw him into his\n",
      "berth, and gave to Fred Macdonald a multitude of directions and\n",
      "cautions, the sober recording of which upon paper was of great service\n",
      "in saving Fred from suffering over the Quixotic aspect which the whole\n",
      "project had begun, in his mind, to take on. He felt ashamed even to\n",
      "look squarely into Crayme’s eye, and his mind was greatly relieved when\n",
      "the captain turned his face to the wall and exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred, for goodness’ sake get out of here; I feel enough like a baby\n",
      "now, without having a nurse alongside. I’ll do well enough for a few\n",
      "hours; just look in once in a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first day of the trip, Crayme made no trouble for himself\n",
      "or Fred: under the friendly shelter of night, the two men had a\n",
      "two-hour chat which was alternately humorous, business-like, and\n",
      "retrospective, and then Crayme fell asleep. The next day was reasonably\n",
      "pleasant out of doors, so the captain wrapped himself in a blanket\n",
      "and sat in an extension-chair on the guards, where with solemn face\n",
      "he received some condolences which went far to keep him in good humor\n",
      "after the sympathizers had departed. On the second night the captain\n",
      "was restless, and the two men played cards. On the third day the\n",
      "captain’s physique reached the bottom of its stock of patience, and\n",
      "protested indignantly at the withdrawal of its customary stimulus; and\n",
      "it acted with more consistency, though no less ugliness, than the human\n",
      "mind does when under excitement and destitute of control. The captain\n",
      "grew terribly despondent, and Fred found ample use for all the good\n",
      "stories he knew. Some of these amused the captain greatly, but after\n",
      "one of them he sighed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor old Billy Hockess told me that the only time I ever heard it\n",
      "before, and _didn’t_ we have a glorious time that night! He’d just\n",
      "put all his money into the _Yenesei_--that blew up and took him with\n",
      "it only a year afterward--and he gave us a new kind of punch he’d got\n",
      "the hang of when he went East for the boat’s carpets. ’Twas made of\n",
      "two bottles of brandy, one whiskey, two rum, one gin, two sherry, and\n",
      "four claret, with guava jelly, and lemon peel that had been soaking in\n",
      "curaçoa and honey for a month. It looks kind of weak when you think\n",
      "about it, but there were only six of us in the party, and it went to\n",
      "the spot by the time we got through. Golly, but didn’t we make Rome\n",
      "howl that night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred shuddered, and experimented upon his friend with song; he was\n",
      "rewarded by hearing the captain hum an occasional accompaniment; but,\n",
      "as Fred got fairly into a merry Irish song about one Terry O’Rann, and\n",
      "uttered the lines in which the poet states that the hero\n",
      "\n",
      "    “--took whiskey punch\n",
      "    Ivery night for his lunch,”\n",
      "\n",
      "the captain put such a world of expression into a long-drawn sigh that\n",
      "Fred began to feel depressed himself; besides, songs were not numerous\n",
      "in Fred’s repertoire, and those in which there was no allusion to\n",
      "drinking could be counted on half his fingers. Then he borrowed the\n",
      "barkeeper’s violin, and played, one after another, the airs which had\n",
      "been his favorites in the days of his courtship, until Crayme exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, Fred, we’re not playing church; give us something that don’t\n",
      "bring all of a fellow’s dead friends along with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred reddened, swung his bow viciously, and dashed into “Natchez Under\n",
      "the Hill,” an old air which would have delighted Offenbach, but which\n",
      "will never appear in a collection of classical music.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that’s something like music,” exclaimed Captain Crayme, as Fred\n",
      "paused suddenly to repair a broken string. “I never hear that but\n",
      "I think of Wesley Treepoke, that used to run the _Quitman_; went\n",
      "afterward to the _Rising Planet_, when the _Quitman’s_ owners put her\n",
      "on a new line as an opposition boat. Wess and I used to work things so\n",
      "as to make Louisville at the same time--he going up, I going down, and\n",
      "then turn about--and we always had a glorious night of it, with one or\n",
      "two other lively boys that we’d pick up. And Wess had a fireman that\n",
      "could fiddle off old ‘Natchez’ in a way that would just make a corpse\n",
      "dance till its teeth rattled, and that fireman would always be called\n",
      "in just as we’d got to the place where you can’t tell what sort of\n",
      "whiskey ’tis you’re drinking, and I tell you, ’twas so heavenly that\n",
      "a fellow could forgive the last boat that beat him on the river, or\n",
      "stole a landing from him. And _such_ whiskey as Wess kept! used to\n",
      "go cruising around the back country, sampling little lots run out of\n",
      "private stills. He’d always find nectar, you’d better believe. Poor\n",
      "old boy! the tremens took him off at last. He hove his pilot overboard\n",
      "just before he died, and put a bullet into Pete Langston, his second\n",
      "clerk--they were both trying to hold him, you see--but they never laid\n",
      "it up against him. I wish I knew what became of the whiskey he had on\n",
      "hand when he walked off--no, I don’t, either; what am I thinking about?\n",
      "But I do, though--hanged if I don’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred grew pale: he had heard of drunkards growing delirious upon\n",
      "ceasing to drink; he had heard of men who, in periods of aberration,\n",
      "were impelled by the motive of the last act or recollection which\n",
      "strongly impressed them; what if the captain should suddenly become\n",
      "delirious, and try to throw _him_ overboard or shoot him? Fred\n",
      "determined to get the captain at once upon the guards--no, into the\n",
      "cabin, where there would be no sight of water to suggest anything\n",
      "dreadful--and search his room for pistols. But the captain objected to\n",
      "being moved into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The boys,” said the captain, alluding to the gamblers, “are mighty\n",
      "sharp in the eye, and like as not they’d see through my little game,\n",
      "and then where’d my reputation be? Speaking of the boys reminds me of\n",
      "Harry Genang, that cleaned out that rich Kentucky planter at bluff one\n",
      "night, and then swore off gambling for life and gave a good-by supper\n",
      "aboard the boat. ’Twas just at the time when Prince Imperial Champagne\n",
      "came out, and the whole supper was made of that splendid stuff. I guess\n",
      "I must have put away four bottles, and if I’d known how much he’d\n",
      "ordered, I could have carried away a couple more. I’ve always been\n",
      "sorry I didn’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred wondered if there was any subject of conversation which would not\n",
      "suggest liquor to the captain; he even brought himself to ask if Crayme\n",
      "had seen the new Methodist Church at Barton since it had been finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes,” said the captain; “I started to walk Moshier home one night,\n",
      "after we’d punished a couple of bottles of old Crow whiskey at our\n",
      "house, and he caved in all of a sudden, and I laid him out on the\n",
      "steps of that very church till I could get a carriage. Those were my\n",
      "last two bottles of Crow, too; it’s too bad the way the good things of\n",
      "this life paddle off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain raised himself in his berth, sat on the edge thereof, stood\n",
      "up, stared out the window, and began to pace his room with his head\n",
      "down and his hands behind his back. Little by little he raised his\n",
      "head, dropped his hands, flung himself into a chair, beat the devil’s\n",
      "tattoo on the table, sprang up excitedly, and exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going back on all the good times I ever had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re only getting ready to try a new kind, Sam,” said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’m going back on my friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not on all of them; the dead ones would pat you on the back, if they\n",
      "got a chance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A world without whiskey looks infernally dismal to a fellow that isn’t\n",
      "half done living.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks first-rate to a fellow that hasn’t got any back-down in him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Curse you! I wish I’d made _you_ back down when you first talked\n",
      "temperance to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go ahead! Then curse your wife--don’t be afraid; you’ve been doing it\n",
      "ever since you married her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crayme flew at Macdonald’s throat; the younger man grappled the\n",
      "captain and threw him into his bunk. The captain struggled and glared\n",
      "like a tiger; Fred gasped, between the special efforts dictated by\n",
      "self-preservation,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sam, I--promised to--to see you--through--and I’m--going to--do it,\n",
      "if--if I have to--break your neck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain made one tremendous effort; Fred braced one foot against\n",
      "the table, put a knee on the captain’s breast, held both the captain’s\n",
      "wrists tightly, looked full into the captain’s eyes, and breathed a\n",
      "small prayer--for his own safety. For a moment or two, perhaps longer,\n",
      "the captain strained violently, and then relaxed all effort and cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fred, you’ve whipped me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense! whip yourself,” exclaimed Fred, “if you’re going to stop\n",
      "drinking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The captain turned his face to the wall and said nothing; but he\n",
      "seemed to be so persistently swallowing something that Fred suspected\n",
      "a secreted bottle, and moved an investigation so suddenly that the\n",
      "captain had not time in which to wipe his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hang it, Fred,” said he, rather brokenly; “how _can_ what’s babyish in\n",
      "men whip a full-grown steamboat captain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The same way that it whipped a full-grown woolen-mill manager once, I\n",
      "suppose, old boy,” said Macdonald.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that so?” exclaimed the captain, astonishment getting so sudden\n",
      "an advantage over shame that he turned over and looked his companion\n",
      "in the face. “Why--how are you, Fred? I feel as if I was just being\n",
      "introduced. Didn’t anybody else help?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Fred, “a woman; but--you’ve got a wife, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Crayme fell back on his pillow and sighed. “If I could only _think_\n",
      "about her, Fred! But I can’t; whiskey’s the only thing that comes into\n",
      "my mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t think about her!” exclaimed Fred; “why, are you acquainted with\n",
      "her yet, I wonder? _I’ll_ never forget the evening you were married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That _was_ jolly, wasn’t it?” said Crayme. “I’ll bet such sherry was\n",
      "never opened west of the Alleghanies, before or----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Hang_ your sherry!” roared Fred; “it’s your wife that I remember.\n",
      "_You_ couldn’t see her, of course, for you were standing alongside of\n",
      "her; but the rest of us--well, I wished myself in your place, that’s\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you, though?” said Crayme, with a smile which seemed rather proud;\n",
      "“well, I guess old Major Pike did too, for he drank to her about twenty\n",
      "times that evening. Let’s see; she wore a white moire antique, I think\n",
      "they called it, and it cost twenty-one dollars a dozen, and there was\n",
      "at least one broken bottle in every----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I made up my mind she was throwing herself away, in marrying a\n",
      "fellow that would be sure to care more for whiskey than he did for\n",
      "her,” interrupted Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ease off, Fred, ease off now; there wasn’t any whiskey there; I tried\n",
      "to get some of the old Twin Tulip brand for punch, but----”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the devil happened to be asleep, and you got a chance to behave\n",
      "yourself,” said Fred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crayme looked appealingly. “Fred,” said he, “tell me about her\n",
      "yourself; I’ll take it as a favor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, she looked like a lot of lilies and roses,” said Fred, “except\n",
      "that you couldn’t tell where one left off and the other began. As she\n",
      "came into the room _I_ felt like getting down on my knees. Old Bayle\n",
      "was telling me a vile story just then, but the minute _she_ came in he\n",
      "stopped as if he was shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wouldn’t drink a drop that evening,” said Crayme, “and I’ve puzzled\n",
      "my wits over that for five years----”\n",

      "\n",

      "Among the Barton people who had actually made any effort for the\n",
      "sake of temperance, no one found greater comfort in contemplative\n",
      "retrospects of his own work than Deacon Jones. True, his contributions\n",
      "to the various funds which Crupp, Tomple, Wedgewell, and Brown devised\n",
      "had not been as great as had been expected of him; nor had such moneys\n",
      "as he finally gave been obtained from him without an amount of effort\n",
      "which Crupp declared sufficient to effect the extraction, from the\n",
      "soil, of the stump of a centenarian oak; but when the money had left\n",
      "his pocket, and was absolutely beyond recall, the deacon made the most\n",
      "he could out of it by the only method which remained. His contributions\n",
      "gave him an excuse for talk and exhortation, and, next to money-making,\n",
      "there was no operation which the deacon enjoyed as much as that of\n",
      "exhorting others to good deeds. Until there broke out in Barton the\n",
      "temperance excitement alluded to in our first chapter, Deacon Jones’s\n",
      "hortatory efforts had been principally of a religious nature; he\n",
      "believed in religion, and he occasionally extracted enjoyment from\n",
      "it; besides, his thrifty soul had always been profoundly moved by the\n",
      "business-like nature of the Scripture passage, “Whoso shall convert\n",
      "a sinner from the error of his ways, shall save a soul from death\n",
      "and cover a multitude of sins.” Many had been the unregenerate in\n",
      "Barton with whom the deacon had labored, generally with considerable\n",
      "tact, as to occasion and language, and sometimes with success. His\n",
      "orthodoxy was acceptable to every pastor in the village, for he was an\n",
      "extreme believer in every religious tenet which either pastor declared\n",
      "necessary to salvation; and his frequent inability to reconcile such\n",
      "of these ideas as conflicted with each other only led the ministers to\n",
      "accord new admiration to a faith which was appalled by nothing. Up to\n",
      "the time when he took active part in the temperance movement, one of\n",
      "his favorite injunctions had been, “Lay up your treasure in heaven;”\n",
      "when, however, he found himself suddenly and frequently called upon\n",
      "for contributions, he dropped this injunction in favor of that one\n",
      "which reads, “Give to him that asketh of thee.” It had been a matter\n",
      "of considerable sorrow to the deacon that his first knowledge of this\n",
      "passage had been derived from St. Luke instead of St. Matthew, and\n",
      "that he had many times been compelled to say “Give to _every man_,”\n",
      "etc., which quotation had reacted upon him in a manner which caused\n",
      "him to quote to himself, “Many are the afflictions of the righteous,”\n",
      "and to suffer some terrible flounderings in the twin pits of logic and\n",
      "casuistry; but when he corrected himself according to Matthew, his\n",
      "heart was gladdened, and his restraint removed. The old man talked a\n",
      "great deal out of honest delight in righteousness and humanity; but he\n",
      "was never moved to reticence by the thought that if his scattered seed\n",
      "produced a fair share of grain, the demands upon his own precious store\n",
      "would be lessened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, the deacon could, with propriety, urge a more conspicuous\n",
      "form of well-doing than mere contributions of currency ever attained\n",
      "to. Had not he himself taken upon his shoulders Tom Adams, driver of\n",
      "the brick-yard team? If any one doubted it, or had never been made\n",
      "acquainted with the fact, the deacon gave him no excuse for farther\n",
      "ignorance. One after another of the well-to-do merchants, professional\n",
      "men, and farmers, were urged by the deacon to take entire charge of\n",
      "some unfortunate soul, after the manner of the deacon himself with Tom,\n",
      "and to all of these he insisted that what he had done for Tom he had\n",
      "been richly paid for by the approving smiles of his own conscience.\n",
      "Shrewd judges of human nature were convinced that if such payment\n",
      "was made to the deacon, he was doubly paid, for Tom Adams had been a\n",
      "treasure of a workman ever since he had stopped drinking; but, with\n",
      "the marvelous blindness of the man who objects to seeing, the deacon\n",

      "to Bible Societies, Missionary Societies, an’ all such things, and yet\n",
      "there was _the_ chance right in my own hands, and I was too blind to\n",

      "dropped a short bark, intended for a cough, which somehow provoked\n",

      "Dr. White sprang up, seized his cane, and asked, “Where is he?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Here!” shouted the deacon, cutting the cords of a “nest” of pails;\n",
      "“take buckets along with you; like enough it’ll need everybody’s help,\n",
      "and the mill’s only half insured, too! Parson, would you mind sittin’\n",

      "shut up store, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly, I’ll stay,” said the old preacher, limping to the front\n",
      "of the store, and laying his hand on the shoulder of the troubled\n",

      "should show you anything inside of yourself, _don’t_ cover your eyes.\n",
      "It’s for righteousness’ sake I ask it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, Brother Brown,” whispered the deacon hoarsely, as he\n",
      "started off with two water-pails in each hand, and murmuring, “What\n",
      "did the old fellow mean by that, I wonder?” Across the street was\n",
      "Squire Tomple, just jumping into his buggy, and the deacon made haste\n",
      "to accept an invitation to a seat beside his fellow-sufferer. The two\n",
      "stockholders did not lack company; Crupp, Judge Macdonald, and most\n",
      "of the other stockholders, either preceded or followed them, and\n",
      "on the road were hundreds of men and boys, full of an enterprising\n",
      "desire to see the largest fire that had ever occurred in Barton, and\n",
      "already experiencing such of the pleasures of anticipation as a heavy\n",
      "column of smoke could create. Coming in sight of the mill itself,\n",
      "the deacon groaned, and the Squire assisted him, for flames were\n",
      "bursting from every window, and the men who had been passing pails of\n",
      "water up ladders and through the stairways had been driven from their\n",
      "work, and had formed a circle which was slowly but steadily widening.\n",
      "Considerable of the wool had been removed and stacked outside the\n",
      "building, and it now became necessary to move this still farther away,\n",
      "but so many hands were ready to seize it that Deacon Jones could not\n",
      "relieve his feelings even by attempting to save property; so he stood\n",
      "still and looked at the fire, as he estimated his losses. Such a day\n",
      "he had not known since he had lost considerable uninsured stock by\n",
      "the explosion of a river steamer. Sidling uneasily about among the\n",
      "crowd, he found several stockholders anxiously comparing pencil notes,\n",
      "and the figures were anything but consolatory supposing all the stock\n",
      "to be saved, there was yet the mill and machinery--value, about ten\n",
      "thousand dollars--which would be totally lost; insurance, five thousand\n",
      "dollars; dead loss, ditto; which left the Squire out of pocket to the\n",
      "extent of a quarter of his subscription. The small profit which had\n",
      "already accrued would not more than cover the loss of the interest on\n",
      "the remaining capital until the mill could be rebuilt, if it seemed\n",
      "advisable to rebuild it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s to blame for all this?” asked the deacon angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We haven’t learned yet,” said the judge, “and I’m afraid it won’t help\n",
      "matters any to know all about it. There goes the last of it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the judge spoke, the blazing frame fell, the small boys shouted\n",
      "“Oh----h!” in chorus, and the deacon’s heart sank like lead as he\n",
      "turned away. He had lost, say, a hundred and fifty dollars by the\n",
      "fire, and Tom Adams’s misfortune would entail additional loss upon\n",
      "him, for a new man would have to be watched and taught and helped,\n",
      "whereas Tom worked as easily as the wheel of a machine. It was but\n",
      "right that the deacon should regret his losses; for though he was a man\n",
      "of considerable property, a dollar looked very large to him, for the\n",
      "reason that his first dollars had each one represented an enormous\n",
      "amount of labor. But when Lawyer Bottom, who had invested in mill stock\n",
      "only with the hope of profit, approached the deacon, and asked, with\n",
      "more curiosity than malice, “How about temperance now, deacon?” the\n",
      "facial contortions which the deacon offered in reply sent the lawyer\n",
      "away in an ecstasy of unholy glee, which almost eradicated his own\n",
      "sense of loss, and which dispelled for a time such little belief as he\n",
      "had in the transforming power of religion. But what is one man’s poison\n",
      "is another’s food. The lawyer’s question was not entirely disposed of\n",
      "by the deacon’s ungracious reply; it repeated itself time and again to\n",
      "the old man, and at the most inopportune times and places; it came to\n",
      "him behind the counter, and made him give wrong weights and measures,\n",
      "with the balance not always in his favor; it came to him when he was\n",
      "making entries in his day-book, and caused him to forget certain items;\n",
      "at his own dinner-table it suddenly made itself heard, and interfered\n",
      "with his relish of the good viands which he so much enjoyed; it dropped\n",
      "in upon him in his dreams, when he could not be on his guard against\n",
      "his better self, and extracted from his conscience a provoking line of\n",
      "answers which in his waking hours he could not gainsay. For three days\n",
      "this depressing experience continued, and then there occurred, at the\n",
      "regular weekly prayer-meeting of Parson Wedgewell’s church, an episode\n",
      "which for months caused mournful reflections in the minds of such of\n",
      "Parson Wedgewell’s parishioners as were not in the habit of attending\n",
      "prayer-meeting. It was noticed by the faithful that Deacon Jones looked\n",
      "unusually solemn and sensitive as he entered the room, and that he\n",
      "did not, as had been hitherto his habit, start the second hymn. This\n",
      "omission having been made good by some enterprising member, however,\n",
      "the deacon got upon his feet and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brethren, during the past few days my eyes have been opened, and what\n",
      "I have seen hasn’t been pleasant to look upon. It is indeed true, my\n",
      "dear friends, that Satan sometimes appears as an angel of light. For\n",
      "months I’ve been feeling, and real happily, too, what a glorious thing\n",
      "it was to do good; I had been instrumental in saving one man from\n",
      "destruction by keeping him busy, and I’d helped save another”--here\n",
      "the deacon paused suddenly and looked around to make sure that Judge\n",
      "Macdonald was not in the room--“I’d helped save another by taking an\n",
      "interest in the mill. But within a few days I’ve learned that my own\n",
      "righteousness was as filthy rags; ’twas even worse than that, brethren,\n",
      "for the worst rags are worth so much a pound, but I can’t find that my\n",
      "righteousness is worth anything at all. I’ve fought it out with myself,\n",
      "brethren, an’ I believe I’ve conquered; but it makes my heart sick to\n",
      "see what my enemy looks like, an’ to think I’ve got to carry him around\n",
      "with me through the rest of my days. Doin’ good’s all right, even if\n",
      "it _does_ pay in dollars and cents, brethren; but doin’ good for the\n",
      "sake of what it’ll bring is the quickest way of makin’ a hypocrite that\n",
      "I ever found, an’ I’m beginnin’ to think that I’ve found a good many\n",
      "ways in myself, my friends. I ask an interest in the prayers of God’s\n",
      "people, an’ I assure ’em that there’s no danger of any of their prayers\n",

      "The deacon dropped into his seat, and the silence that prevailed for a\n",
      "moment was simply inevitable in a little company that had never before\n",

      "remarked, it sounded like a murderer’s last dying speech. Then good\n",
      "Parson Wedgewell sprang to his feet, and, with streaming eyes and rapid\n",
      "utterances, offered a prayer such as had never been heard in that room\n",
      "before. The songs and prayers which followed were not those to which\n",

      "was far too great to be endured with comfort. To find a way of getting\n",
      "out of the whole matter was a suggestion which came frequently to the\n",
      "heart of the old man, and was not as rigidly excluded as it would have\n",
      "been from that of the reader; but fortunately for the honesty of Father\n",

      "as thousands of his betters have done when unable, by any abandonment\n",
      "of self-respect, to avoid the inevitable: he submitted, and groaned\n",

      "now scantily, as he thought of what might be his own fate if the crop\n",
      "should be troubled with rust, or blight, or rain, or drought. And all\n",

      "read in the weather which suggested them. When a heavy rain at last\n",

      "the Tappelmine estate. Father Baguss ached in soul and body, but the\n",
      "wheat-field work was but the beginning of sorrow. The Tappelmine\n",
      "larder was bareness itself; there was not a porker in the Tappelmine\n",
      "pen; there was not even corn enough in the Tappelmine crib to feed\n",
      "the family horse, let alone to send to mill, and be ground into the\n",
      "meal which the Tappelmines fortunately preferred to fine flour.\n",
      "Father Baguss sold the necessities of life in small quantities to his\n",
      "neighbor, with the understanding that they were to be repaid by the\n",
      "labor of Tappelmine, who was to get out material for barrel-staves\n",
      "and wheelwright’s spokes on the old man’s woodland; but, by the time\n",
      "the wheat was planted, Tappelmine, who, under the eye of Baguss, did\n",

      "but these three reformers, knowing that Baguss could afford the loss,\n",
      "quietly agreed with each other that it would be indeed consolatory\n",
      "to have a companion in experience; so they made excuses, and quoted\n",
      "figures in evidence, and Father Baguss went home with the settled\n",
      "conviction that he would have to look to Providence for his only\n",
      "assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Providence was thus reforming Father Baguss, Tappelmine was\n",
      "growing steadily weaker, and Baguss found his causes of discomfort\n",
      "increased by a debate, which lasted long in his mind, whether it might\n",
      "not be better, for the sake of the drunkard’s family, to let Tappelmine\n",
      "die, and then lease the farm himself at a price which would support the\n",
      "widow. While one phase of the case was present in his mind, he would\n",
      "suggest to the doctor that medicine didn’t seem to do any good--which\n",
      "was certainly true--and that he didn’t believe it would pay to come so\n",
      "often; when, on the contrary, conscience would argue for its own side,\n",
      "the old man would have all three of the physicians visit Tappelmine in\n",
      "rapid succession. The doctors disagreed, as any one but Father Baguss\n",
      "would have known. Perry suggested electrical treatment, which would\n",
      "necessitate the purchase of a battery, no such piece of mechanism\n",
      "having ever been seen in the town except in a locked cabinet of the\n",
      "Barton High School. Dr. White outlined a course of treatment which\n",
      "seemed reasonable to Father Baguss, but which, put into practice, did\n",
      "neither good nor harm; while Pykem arranged for certain inexpensive\n",
      "applications of water, with results which were in the main encouraging.\n",
      "But Tappelmine was unable to leave his bed for three months, and when\n",
      "he was at all fit to work, he could labor for but two or three hours a\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so Father Baguss found himself brought down to the position of a\n",
      "man who was spending money without knowing what he was to get for it.\n",
      "Such a position he had never occupied before, and no one could wonder\n",
      "that he felt uncomfortable in it; but the duration of the period was\n",
      "such that the victim succumbed to the steady pressure of truths which,\n",
      "in their abstract form, would have been as ineffective against him\n",
      "as against an acute logician whose intellect had been trained by his\n",
      "pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Father Baguss was not the only instrument of the salvation of\n",
      "Tappelmine. In existence, but scarcely known of or recognized, there\n",
      "was a Mrs. Tappelmine. With face, hair, eyes, and garments of the\n",
      "same color, the color itself being neutral; small, thin, faded,\n",
      "inconspicuous, poorly clad, bent with labors which had yielded no\n",
      "return, as dead to the world as saints strive to be, yet remaining in\n",
      "the world for the sake of those whom she had often wished out of it,\n",
      "Mrs. Tappelmine devoted herself to the wreck of what was once a hope\n",
      "over which her eyes had been of a luster which high-born maidens had\n",
      "envied, and a hope in which her heart had throbbed with a joy which had\n",
      "seemed too great for life to hold. About the bedside of her husband\n",
      "she hovered day and night. When she slept no one but herself knew, and\n",
      "she herself did not care. When Tappelmine made his verbal agreement\n",
      "with Father Baguss, she had listened with a joy whose earnestness was\n",
      "as nothing compared with her resolution. She had hurried away from the\n",
      "broken window to a corner where her dirty children were at quarrelsome\n",
      "play, and she had bestowed upon each of them a passionate caress\n",
      "which startled even the little wretches themselves into wondering\n",
      "silence. From that moment she watched her husband’s every movement, and\n",
      "Tappelmine, like a true Pike--for the Pike, like the Transcendentalist,\n",
      "existed ages before he found his way into literature--Tappelmine\n",
      "subjected himself into his wife’s dominion. He made numberless excuses\n",
      "to go to some place where liquor could be found; she, with the wisdom\n",
      "of the serpent, yet the gentleness of the dove, prevented him. As,\n",
      "through the course of her husband’s labors, under the eye of Baguss, he\n",
      "had grown more silent than ever, she had increased her exertions for\n",
      "his comfort; when, finally, the task was completed, and Tappelmine,\n",
      "with thinner face and hollower eyes than ever, fell heavily upon his\n",
      "rude bed and uttered--almost screamed--the single word “Whiskey!” she\n",
      "was on her knees beside him in an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry,” she exclaimed, “you’ve got the better of whiskey these late\n",
      "days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just a drop more--to keep me from dying,” gasped Tappelmine.\n",
      "\n",

      "die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just a drop, for God’s sake, Mariar!” said Tappelmine imploringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Jerry!” replied the wife, “don’t--for the children’s sake; _they’re_\n",
      "more to you than God is. I hope he’ll forgive me for sayin’ it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“I’ll be all right in a day or two, Mariar, if I only get a taste.\n",
      "You don’t want a sick man a-layin’ around, not fit to do for his young\n",
      "ones?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t need to, Jerry. _I’ll_ do for ’em, if you’ll only--only make\n",
      "’em proud of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’ll make me good for more to _you_, old woman--one single mouthful\n",

      "\n",
      "“Would be better off alongside of me in the ground, rather than have\n",
      "their dad go backwards again,” said Mrs. Tappelmine. “People turn up\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, Jerry, when the children go ’long the road--God knows I don’t let\n",

      "poor clothes, an’ not lookin’ over an’ above fed up, an’ they can’t\n",
      "help kind o’ twitchin’ up their faces at ’em once there was a time when\n",
      "I couldn’t have helped doin’ it to young ones lookin’ that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Curse_ people!” exclaimed Tappelmine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They do it to me, too,” continued the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tappelmine sprang up, and exclaimed fiercely,\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Cause--’cause you’ve made ’em, I reckon, Jerry,” answered Mrs.\n",
      "Tappelmine with some difficulty, occasioned by some choking sobs which\n",
      "nearly took exclusive possession of her. “You know, Jerry, I don’t\n",
      "say it to complain--complainin’ never seems to bring one any good to\n",
      "a woman like me; but--if you only knowed how folks look at me in--in\n",
      "stores, an’ everywhere else, you--wouldn’t blame me for not likin’ it.\n",
      "_I_ didn’t ever do anything to bring it about, unless ’twas in marryin’\n",
      "_you_, and I _ain’t_ sorry I did _that_; but I wish I didn’t ever have\n",
      "to see anybody again, if you’re goin’ to keep on drinkin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The sick man fell back and was silent; his wife threw herself beside\n",
      "him, crying,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t get mad at me, Jerry; God knows it’s the deadest truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a moment or two Tappelmine laid a hand on his wife’s cheek, where\n",
      "it had not been before for twenty years; once its touch had brought\n",
      "blushes; now, tears hurried down to meet it, and yet Mrs. Tappelmine\n",
      "was happier than when she had been a pretty Kentucky girl, twenty years\n",
      "before.\n",

      "The apartments in the Tappelmine mansion were so few that it was\n",
      "impossible for anything unusual to transpire without attracting the\n",
      "attention of all the inmates; so it followed that the children,\n",
      "beholding the actions of their parents, had gradually approached the\n",
      "bed with countenances whose blankness was painfully eloquent to the\n",
      "sick man. Tappelmine looked at them, and grew more miserable of visage;\n",
      "he hid his face beside his wife, groaned “No more whiskey if I die\n",
      "for it!” and jumped up and kissed each of his children, while Mrs.\n",
      "Tappelmine sobbed aloud, and Father Baguss, who, coming over a few\n",
      "moments before to talk business, had heard the simple word “whiskey,”\n",
      "and had since been jealously listening under the window, sneaked away\n",
      "muttering to himself,\n",

      "\n",
      "THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire which destroyed the Mississippi Valley Woolen Mills did such\n",
      "damage in the ranks of the temperance reformers that for a few months\n",
      "Crupp, Tomple, and several others had frequent cause to feel lonesome,\n",
      "while poor Father Baguss fell back upon the church for that comfort\n",
      "which, just after his first effort with Tappelmine, and before the\n",
      "fire, he had frequently found in the society of his self-approving\n",
      "brother stockholders. The mill was rebuilt, only a few of the owners\n",
      "of stock refusing to be assessed for their proportion of the loss; the\n",
      "mill made a very prosperous winter, and interested persons were not\n",
      "averse to talking about it; but after Deacon Jones’ speech was noised\n",
      "abroad, the mill was no longer a semi-holy topic of conversation,\n",
      "which was allowable even on the church steps on Sundays. Some of the\n",
      "men whose eyes had been opened toward themselves, on the occasion of\n",
      "the fire, were honest enough to confess to themselves, and to bring\n",
      "forth fruits meet for repentance; but the majority took refuge either\n",
      "in open or secret sophistry, with the comforting impression that they\n",
      "blinded others as effectually as they did themselves. The mass of the\n",
      "people, however--those who neither subscribed to temperance funds, nor\n",
      "mill stock, nor anything else, still looked on, and were plethoric of\n",
      "encouragement and criticism. When appealed to for help, their logic\n",
      "was simply bewildering, and almost as depraved as the same defensive\n",
      "and offensive weapon is in politics. Tomple was the man to do such\n",
      "work, said some, for he was the rich man of the village, and rich men\n",
      "are only God’s stewards; others suggested Captain Crayme, who had\n",
      "money, and who should be willing to spend considerable of it as a\n",
      "thank-offering for his own providential deliverance from the thraldom\n",
      "of drink. The irreligious thought that all such work should be done by\n",
      "the church, if churches were good for anything but to shout in; while\n",
      "the religious felt that the irreligious, among whom could be found\n",
      "nearly every drinker in the village, should expend whatever money was\n",
      "needed for the physical reformation of their kind. Where none of these\n",
      "excuses seemed available, or wherever two or three conservatives of\n",
      "differing views met together, there was always Crupp to fall back\n",
      "upon; each man could grasp his own pocket-book with tender tenacity,\n",
      "and declare to a sympathetic audience that the man who had coined his\n",
      "money out of widows’ tears and orphans’ groans should by rights take\n",
      "care of all the drunkards in the county, even until he was so reduced\n",
      "in means as to be dependent upon public charity for his own support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus matters stood when a year had elapsed since the memorable\n",
      "temperance meeting, and Parson Wedgewell suggested that an anniversary\n",
      "service would be only an ordinary and decent testimonial of respect to\n",
      "Providence for his special mercies during the year. To the parson’s\n",
      "surprise, Crupp who--though he had during the winter surprised every\n",
      "one by joining Parson Wedgewell’s church, in spite of a very severe\n",
      "course of questioning by the Examining Committee--was still a man of\n",
      "action and a contemner of mere words--Crupp not only failed to oppose\n",
      "such a meeting, but volunteered himself to write for Major Ben Bailey,\n",
      "the gifted orator who had addressed the earlier meeting, and to pay the\n",
      "orator’s expenses. Such offers were rarely made, even by the Barton\n",
      "reformers, so by unanimous consent Crupp wrote to the great lecturer,\n",
      "it being admitted by Tomple, Wedgewell, Baguss, and Jones, that Crupp’s\n",
      "idea of informing the Major what had been done during the year was a\n",
      "good one, and that it would enable the orator to modify his address\n",
      "with special reference to existing circumstances. But Squire Tomple\n",
      "and the parson were considerably astonished to see Crupp dash into the\n",
      "Squire’s store one day, exhibiting an unusual degree of excitement, as\n",
      "he unfolded a letter and remarked,\n",
      "\n",
      "“He won’t come! Just listen to what he says!” And while the two other\n",
      "reformers stood as if they saw the sky falling and did not despair of\n",
      "catching it in their eyes and mouths, Crupp read:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In replying to Mr. Crupp’s favor of the --th, Major Bailey can only\n",
      "say, that while he should be glad to again meet the people among whom\n",
      "so great an amount of good has been accomplished within the year, he\n",
      "cannot see that he can render any service. Major Bailey’s efforts are\n",
      "confined solely to the awakening of an interest in temperance; the\n",
      "condition of affairs which Mr. Crupp reports as existing in Barton,\n",
      "however, indicates a degree of interest which cannot be heightened by\n",
      "any effort which the writer could put forth. What seems desirable at\n",
      "Barton is such an informing of the general populace upon what has been\n",
      "accomplished, upon the manner in which the work has been done, and the\n",
      "comparatively small number of persons who have actively participated\n",
      "in it, as shall convince the inhabitants that they did not fulfill\n",
      "their whole duty toward temperance when a year ago they applauded the\n",
      "utterances of the writer of these lines. Briefly, Major Bailey feels\n",
      "that if he attended, he could contribute only such efforts as, under\n",
      "the circumstances, would be entirely out of place.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Astonishing!” exclaimed Parson Wedgewell, with the eye of a man who\n",
      "dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Threw away a job!” said Tomple, like the thrifty business man that he\n",
      "was.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the meeting was planned and widely advertised, and when, on the\n",
      "evening appointed, the attendants looked over the room, they found\n",
      "occasion for considerable attentive reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except that Major Ben Bailey, the gifted orator, was not present, the\n",
      "meeting presented the same attractions which had drawn such a crowd to\n",
      "its predecessor. The Barton Brass Band was there, and with some new\n",
      "airs learned during the year; the Crystal Spring Glee Club was there;\n",
      "there were the pastors of the four churches in Barton, and Squire\n",
      "Tomple was in the chair as before. Besides, there were additional\n",
      "attractions: Crupp, a year before, the man who was lending to liquor\n",
      "selling an air of respectability, was upon the platform to the left\n",
      "and rear of Squire Tomple; old Bunley, who a year before had been\n",
      "responsible only as a container of alcohol, but now a respectable\n",
      "citizen and book-keeper to Squire Tomple, occupied the secretary’s\n",
      "chair; Tom Adams acted as usher in one of the side-aisles, and dragged\n",
      "all the heavy drinkers up to front seats; Harry Wainright was there,\n",
      "with a wife whose veil was not thick enough to hide her happiness; Fred\n",
      "Macdonald, who had spent the evening of the other meeting in the Barton\n",
      "House bar-room, was there; so was Tappelmine, appearing as ill at\n",
      "ease as a porker in a strange field, but still there; while in a side\n",
      "seat, close to the wall, sitting as much in the shadow of his wife as\n",
      "possible, so as to guard his professional reputation, was Sam Crayme,\n",
      "captain of the steamer _Excellence_. A number of “the boys” were there\n",
      "also, and yet the church was not only not crowded, but not even full.\n",
      "During the year temperance had been guided from the hearts to the\n",
      "pockets of a great many, and this radical treatment had been fatal to\n",
      "many an enthusiastic soul that had theretofore been blameless in its\n",
      "own eyes. Those who attended heard some music, however, which was not\n",
      "deficient in point of quality; they heard a short but live address from\n",
      "old Parson Fish on the moral beauty of a temperate life, and an earnest\n",
      "prayer from that one of the Barton pastors who had during the year done\n",
      "nothing which justified the mention of his name in this history, and\n",
      "then the audience saw Mr. Crupp advance to the front of the platform\n",
      "and unfold a large sheet of paper, which he crumpled in one hand as he\n",
      "spoke as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ladies and gentlemen: having been requested, by the chairman of the\n",
      "last meeting, to collect some statistics of the work accomplished in\n",
      "Barton, during the past year, in the cause of temperance, I invite your\n",
      "attention to the following figures:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Population of township last year, three thousand two hundred and\n",
      "sixty-five. Signatures to pledge, at last meeting, six hundred and\n",
      "twenty-seven [applause]; signatures of persons who were in the habit\n",
      "of drinking at time of signing, two hundred and thirty-one; number\n",
      "of persons who have broken the pledge since signing, one hundred\n",
      "and sixty [sighs and groans]; number of persons who have kept their\n",
      "pledges, seventy-one [applause]; number reclaimed by personal effort\n",
      "since meeting, forty-six [applause]; amount of money subscribed and\n",
      "applied strictly for the good of the cause, and without hope of\n",
      "pecuniary gain [a faint hiss or two], five thousand one hundred and\n",
      "ninety dollars and thirty-eight cents [tremendous applause]; amount\n",
      "which has been returned by the beneficiaries without solicitation,\n",
      "twenty-seven dollars [laughter, hisses, and groans]. Of the amount\n",
      "subscribed, _six-sevenths_ came from _five_ persons, who own less than\n",
      "_one-fiftieth_ part of the taxable property of the township.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The quiet which prevailed, as Mr. Crupp spoke these last words and took\n",
      "his seat, was, if considered only _as_ quiet, simply faultless; but its\n",
      "duration was greater and more annoying than things purely faultless\n",
      "usually are, and there was a general sensation of relief when Squire\n",
      "Tomple, who during the year had not made any public display of his\n",
      "charities, and who was popularly supposed to care as much for a dollar\n",
      "as any one, slowly got upon his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friends,” said the Squire, “I’m more than ever convinced that\n",
      "temperance is a good thing [hearty applause], and the reason I feel\n",
      "so is, that during the year I’ve put considerable money into it; and\n",
      "where the treasure is there shall the heart be also [dead silence].\n",
      "I’ve made up my mind, that hurrahing and singing for temperance will\n",
      "make a hypocrite out of a saint, if he don’t use money and effort at\n",
      "the same time. I like a good song and a good time as much as anybody,\n",
      "but I can’t learn of a single drinking man that they have reformed.\n",
      "At our last meeting there was some good work _started_, by the use\n",
      "of songs and speeches, and you have learned, from the report just\n",
      "presented, how much lasting good they did. Money and work have done\n",
      "the business, my friends; talk has helped, but alone by itself it’s\n",
      "done precious little. This lesson has cost _me_ a great deal; and as\n",
      "a business man, who believes that _every_ earthly interest is in some\n",
      "way a business interest, I advise you to learn the same lesson for\n",
      "yourselves before it is too late.”\n",

      "SCRIPTURES and THE HOLY FATHERS and the most esteemed Councils and the\n",

      "have always been unanimously taught by the Fathers_, _and have always\n",
      "been invariably received by the Church Universal_. {8g}\n",
      "\n",

      "particular doctrine of the Roman Church; next, to bring forward either\n",
      "the silence or the declarations of Scripture; and, lastly, to adduce the\n",
      "testimony of the Fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  By the adoption of such a plan, without a grain of any extraordinary\n",
      "learning, and by the mere exercise of common sense, every reader will be\n",
      "enabled fully to judge for himself.\n",

      "\n",
      "I.  The following, as defined by the Council of Trent, is the doctrine of\n",
      "the Roman Church with respect to the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  _In the sacrament of the Eucharist_, _after the consecration of the\n",
      "bread and wine_, _our Lord Jesus Christ_, _true God and true man_, _is_,\n",
      "_truly and really and substantially_, _contained_, _under the species of\n",
      "those sensible objects_: _so that_, _immediately after consecration_,\n",
      "_the true body and the true blood of our Lord_, _together with his soul\n",
      "and divinity_, _exist under the species of bread and wine_: _for_, _by\n",
      "the very force of the words themselves_, _the blood exists under the\n",
      "species of the wine_; _and the body_, _under the species of the breed_.\n",

      "concomitance_, _through which the parts of the Lord_, _after his\n",
      "resurrection from the dead_, _are mutually joined together_, _the body\n",
      "exists under the species of the wine_, _the blood exists under the\n",
      "species of the bread_, _and the soul exists under the species both of the\n",
      "bread and the wine_.  _The divinity_, _moreover_, _on account of its\n",
      "admirable hypostatic union with the body and the soul_, _similarly exists\n",
      "alike under each species_.  _Wherefore_, _under each species and under\n",
      "both species_, _so much as even the whole is contained_.  _For the entire\n",
      "Christ exists both under the species of bread_, _and under each particle\n",
      "of that species_: _and the entire Christ exists_, _both under the species\n",
      "of wine_, _and under all the particles of that species_.  _Hence_,\n",
      "_through the consecration of the bread and wine_, _there takes place a\n",
      "conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the\n",
      "body of our Lord Christ_, _and of the whole substance of the wine into\n",
      "the substance of his blood_: _which conversion is properly and\n",
      "conveniently denominated Transubstantiation_.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  _All the faithful are bound to offer to the Eucharist that same\n",
      "adoration of Latria_, _which is paid to the Deity_: _for such adoration\n",

      "all the angels of God worship him_.  _And_, _analogously_, _in point of\n",
      "beneficial efficacy_, _the Eucharist_, _being the identical sacrifice\n",
      "which Christ __offered upon the cross_, _must be deemed a true\n",

      "\n",
      "II.  Let us now hear Scripture with respect to this same holy sacrament.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  _I am the living bread_, _which came down from heaven_.  _If any man\n",
      "eat of this bread_, _he shall live for ever_: _and the bread that I will\n",
      "give is my flesh_, _which I will give for the life of the world_.  _The\n",
      "Jews_, _therefore_, _strove among themselves_, _saying_: _How can this\n",
      "man give us his flesh to eat_?  _Then Jesus said unto them_: _Verily_,\n",
      "_verily_, _I say unto you_; _Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man\n",
      "and drink his blood_, _ye have no life in you_.  _Whoso eateth my flesh_,\n",
      "_and drinketh my blood_, _hath eternal life_: _and I will raise him up at\n",
      "the last day_.  _For my flesh is meat indeed_: _and my blood is drink\n",
      "indeed_.  _He_, _that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood_, _dwelleth\n",
      "in me_, _and I in him_—_These sayings said he in the synagogue_, _as he\n",
      "taught in Capernaum_.  _Many_, _therefore_, _of his disciples_, _when\n",
      "they had heard this_, _said_: _This is an hard saying_; _who can hear\n",
      "it_?  _When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it_, _he\n",
      "said unto them_: _Doth this offend you_?  _What and if ye shall see the\n",
      "Son of man ascend up where he was before_?  IT IS THE SPIRIT THAT\n",
      "QUICKENETH: THE FLESH PROFITETH NOTHING.  THE WORDS, THAT I SPEAK UNTO\n",
      "YOU, ARE SPIRIT AND LIFE. {11b}\n",
      "\n",
      "When our Lord enforced the necessity of eating his flesh and of drinking\n",
      "his blood, the Jews and even his disciples, understanding him _literally_\n",
      "just as the Romish Clergy _now_ expound his language, murmured at so hard\n",
      "a saying, and asked how he could possibly give men his flesh to eat.\n",
      "Whereupon Christ, in the avowed way of explanation, immediately declared:\n",
      "that _the words_, _which he spake_, _are spirit_; and that _the flesh\n",
      "profiteth nothing_.  Clearly, therefore, according to his own distinct\n",
      "explanation, his words are to be understood _spiritually_ or\n",
      "_figuratively_, not _carnally_ or _literally_.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  _As they were eating_, _Jesus took bread_, _and blessed_, _and\n",
      "brake_, _and gave to his disciples_, _and said_: _Take_, _eat_; _this is\n",
      "my body_.  _And he took the cup_, _and gave thanks_, _and gave to them_,\n",
      "_saying_: _Drink ye all of it_; _for this is my blood of the New\n",

      "_until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom_.\n",
      "{12a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  The authoritative interpretation of such language, as that which is\n",
      "here employed by our Lord, had already been given by him at Capernaum.\n",
      "His words are to be understood _spiritually_ or _figuratively_: just as\n",
      "when he declared himself to be a _vine_ and his disciples to be\n",
      "_branches_. {12b}\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, even _after_ consecration, when the Romish Clergy assert the\n",
      "wine to have been literally transubstantiated into the actual material\n",
      "blood of Christ; he himself still calls it _this fruit of the vine_: an\n",
      "appellation, if we receive as scriptural truth the doctrine of\n",
      "Transubstantiation, _then_ clearly false and erroneous and inaccurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  We may note, that the Apostles expressed not the least surprise, or\n",
      "uttered the smallest murmur, on account of our Lord’s phraseology, when\n",
      "he instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason is obvious, though the fact is highly worth our special\n",
      "attention.  They had heard and recollected his own explanation of the\n",
      "parallel language which he employed at Capernaum.  Hence they _now_, as a\n",
      "matter of course, understood him to speak _figuratively_, not\n",
      "_literally_: and hence, what was the natural result, his words _now_ gave\n",
      "them NO offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  _I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you_:\n",
      "_that The Lord Jesus_, _the night in which he was betrayed_, _took\n",
      "bread_: _and_, _when he had given thanks_, _he brake_, _and said_:\n",
      "_Take_, _eat_; _this is my body_, _which is broken for you_: _this do in\n",
      "remembrance of me_.  _After the same manner also_, _the cup_, _when he\n",
      "had supped_, _saying_: _This cup is the New Testament in my blood_: _this\n",
      "do ye as oft as ye drink_, _in remembrance of me_.  _For_, _as often as\n",
      "ye eat_ THIS BREAD _and drink_ THIS CUP, _ye do shew the Lord’s death\n",
      "till he come_.  _Wherefore_, _whosoever shall eat_ THIS BREAD _and drink_\n",
      "THIS CUP _of the Lord unworthily_, _shall be guilty of the body and blood\n",
      "of the Lord_.  _But let a man examine himself_: _and so let him eat of_\n",
      "THE BREAD, _and drink of_ THE CUP. {13a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  The language of St. Paul exactly corresponds with the language of\n",
      "Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after consecration, the Apostle, we may observe, still repeatedly\n",
      "calls the elements _this bread_ and _this cup_ or _the bread_ and _the\n",
      "cup_.  Yet he could not _truly_ have thus called them: if, all the while,\n",
      "they had become, by transubstantiation, literal human flesh and literal\n",
      "human blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  We may here again note, that the _true_ doctrine of the Eucharist,\n",
      "as undoubtedly delivered by St. Paul to the gentile converts of Corinth,\n",
      "does not appear to have excited either surprise or offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whence the presumption, or rather indeed the certainty, is: that, in\n",
      "delivering it to them, he distinctly taught, on the authority of his Lord\n",
      "and Master, that _it is the spirit which quickeneth_, that _the flesh\n",
      "profiteth nothing_, and that _the words spoken by Christ are spirit and\n",
      "life_.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  As our Saviour thus fully explains his own phraseology: so, in strict\n",
      "congruity with his explanation; on the existence, of the soul and\n",
      "divinity of Christ in the consecrated elements, and on the adoration of\n",
      "those elements with the very same adoration as that which is paid to the\n",
      "Deity, Holy Scripture is PROFOUNDLY SILENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "From whatever quarter the duty of such worship was learned by the Romish\n",
      "Priesthood, it assuredly was _not_ learned from the Bible.  The written\n",
      "word of God neither enjoins it, nor gives a single instance of its ever\n",
      "having being paid either in the time or with the sanction of the\n",
      "Apostles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  EQUALLY SILENT also is the Bible, respecting the alleged\n",
      "circumstance: that _The celebration of the Eucharist is a true\n",
      "propitiatory sacrifice both for the quick and for the dead_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Church of Rome, indeed, teaches this doctrine: but she did _not_\n",
      "learn it from Scripture.\n",
      "\n",
      "III.  We may now, with advantage, proceed to hear the declarations of the\n",
      "Fathers concerning the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Clement of Alexandria lived in the second century.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  The Scripture has named wine A MYSTIC SYMBOL of the holy blood.\n",
      "{14a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  Know well, that the Lord himself also partook of WINE: for he\n",
      "himself also was a man.  And he blessed the wine, saying: _Take_,\n",
      "_drink_; _this is my blood_, _the blood of the vine_.  The holy stream of\n",
      "exhilaration ALLEGORICALLY REPRESENTS the Word, who poured himself out on\n",
      "behalf of many, for the remission of sins. {14b}\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Tertullian flourished at the end of the second and at the beginning\n",
      "of the third century.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  We must not call our senses in question, lest we should doubt\n",
      "respecting their fidelity even in the case of Christ himself.  For, if we\n",
      "question their fidelity, we might be led to say: that Christ—TASTED A\n",
      "DIFFERENT FLAVOUR OF THE WINE WHICH HE CONSECRATED IN MEMORY OF HIS OWN\n",
      "BLOOD. {15a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  If Christ declares, that _The_ FLESH _profiteth nothing_; the sense\n",
      "must be decided from the matter of the saying.  For, because the Jews\n",
      "deemed his discourse hard and intolerable, as if he had truly determined\n",
      "that his FLESH was to be eaten by them: in order that he might dispose\n",
      "the state of salvation TOWARD THE SPIRIT, he promised; _It is the_ SPIRIT\n",
      "_that quickeneth_.  And thus he subjoined: _The_ FLESH _profiteth\n",
      "nothing_, namely, to quicken.  There follows also, WHAT HE WOULD HAVE US\n",
      "UNDERSTAND BY SPIRIT.  _The words_, _which I have spoken unto you_, _are\n",
      "spirit and life_. {15b}\n",
      "\n",
      "(3.)  Christ reprobated, neither the water of the Creator with which he\n",
      "washes his people, nor the oil with which he anoints them, nor the\n",
      "fellowship of honey and milk with which he feeds them as infants, nor the\n",
      "BREAD by which he REPRESENTS his own body: for, even in his sacraments,\n",
      "he needs the beggarly elements of the Creator. {15c}\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Athanasius flourished in the fourth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our Lord conversed on the eating of his body, and when he thence\n",
      "beheld many scandalised, he forthwith added: _Doth this offend you_?\n",
      "_What if ye shall behold the Son of man ascending where he was before_?\n",
      "_It is the spirit that quickeneth_: _the flesh profiteth nothing_.  _The\n",
      "words_, _which I speak unto you_, _are spirit and life_.  Both these\n",
      "matters, THE FLESH and THE SPIRIT, he said respecting himself.  And he\n",
      "distinguished the spirit from the flesh: IN ORDER THAT, BELIEVING BOTH\n",
      "THE VISIBLE AND THE INVISIBLE, THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND HIS SAYINGS TO BE\n",
      "NOT CARNAL BUT SPIRITUAL.  For TO HOW MANY PERSONS COULD HIS BODY HAVE\n",
      "SUFFICED FOR FOOD: SO THAT IT MIGHT BECOME THE ALIMENT OF THE WHOLE\n",
      "WORLD?  But, that he might divert their minds from carnal cogitations,\n",
      "and that they might learn the flesh which he would give them to be\n",
      "supercelestial and spiritual food: he, on this account, mentioned the\n",
      "ascent of the Son of man to heaven.  _The words_, said he, _which I speak\n",
      "unto you_, _are spirit and life_.  As if he had intimated: My body shall\n",
      "be exhibited and given as food for the world; so THAT THAT FOOD SHALL BE\n",
      "GIVEN TO EACH ONE SPIRITUALLY, and shall to all be a preservative to the\n",
      "resurrection unto life eternal. {16a}\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Eusebius of Cesarèa lived in the fourth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  Christ himself gave the SYMBOLS of the divine economy to his own\n",
      "disciples; commanding, that the IMAGE of his own body should be made.\n",
      "{16b}\n",
      "\n",

      "stone, differing nothing from those other flat tablets, which are built\n",
      "into our walls or which ornament our pavements; but, when it has been\n",
      "dedicated to the service of God and has received the benediction, it is a\n",
      "holy table, an unpolluted altar, no longer indiscriminately handled by\n",
      "all, but touched only by the priests and even by them with pious caution:\n",
      "and, again, since the bread is originally mere common bread; but, when\n",
      "the mystery shall have wrought its sanctification, it is both called and\n",

      "moreover, effects a venerable and honourable priest: when, through the\n",
      "newness of the benediction, the individual is separated from common\n",
      "fellowship with the many.  For, only yesterday and the day before, he was\n",
      "nothing more than one out of the many, nothing more than one of the\n",
      "laity: but now he is set forth, as a leader, as a precessor, as a teacher\n",
      "of piety, as a heirophant of the hidden mysteries.  And these things he\n",

      "was the interpretation received as orthodox by the universal Church at\n",
      "the times when they respectively flourished, we have the following very\n",
      "distinct and very important results.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  The consecrated elements are IMAGES or SYMBOLS or TYPES or SIGNS or\n",
      "REPRESENTATIONS of the body and blood of Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  Communicants do NOT partake of that _literal_ body and blood, in\n",
      "which the Lord suffered and which he shed on the cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3.)  The symbols of bread and wine, AFTER consecration, STILL REMAIN\n",
      "UNCHANGED IN THEIR ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE: and, consequently, they are NOT\n",
      "transubstantiated.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4.)  Christ called the bread and wine _his body and blood_, IN THE SAME\n",
      "SENSE and ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE that he called himself _a vine_.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5.)  When the early writers style the bread and wine _the body and blood\n",
      "of Christ_; or when they say, that _the bread and wine are the body and\n",
      "blood of Christ_; or when they affirm, that _the bread and wine are\n",
      "changed into the body and blood of Christ_: they themselves state, by way\n",
      "of explanation, that they only speak metonymically and figuratively.  For\n",
      "they distinctly tell us: that they are wont to call the bread and wine\n",
      "_Christ’s body and blood_; NOT BECAUSE THE BREAD IS PROPERLY HIS BODY, OR\n",
      "BECAUSE THE WINE IS PROPERLY HIS BLOOD; but only because they contain the\n",
      "sacrament of his body and blood within themselves, or because the IMAGE\n",
      "and SIMILITUDE of his body and blood are exhibited in the due celebration\n",
      "of the Eucharist.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6.)  Hence, in strict consistency, the _sole_ change in the elements,\n",
      "produced by consecration, is said, by the same early writers, to be a\n",
      "MORAL and not a PHYSICAL change.  For they pronounce it to be such a\n",
      "change, as is produced in the confirmatory chrism or in the stone of an\n",
      "altar-table or in the baptismal water; when, by consecration, they cease\n",
      "to be secular, and are devoted to sacred purposes: and, even yet more\n",

      "I.  Respecting a Purgatory, into which the souls of all, save those who\n",

      "that, by its fiery pains, they may be purified from the remainder of\n",
      "their corruption, and at the same time by personal suffering may make\n",
      "satisfaction to God for their hitherto unexpiated offences: the Church of\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  On this point, we may begin with very safely remarking: that, from\n",
      "the first verse of Genesis to the last verse of the Revelation, God’s\n",
      "written word, whether jewish or christian, SAYS NOT A SINGLE SYLLABLE\n",
      "concerning the existence of any such place as a romish Purgatory.\n",

      "suffrages or prayers of the faithful and most especially by the\n",
      "acceptable sacrifice of the altar_.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  But Holy Scripture is not merely SILENT on this subject: by\n",
      "anticipation, it even FLATLY CONTRADICTS the popish doctrine before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I heard a voice from heaven_, _saying unto me_: _Write_; _Blessed are\n",
      "the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth_: _Yea_, _saith the\n",
      "Spirit_, THAT THEY MAY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS; _and their works do\n",
      "follow them_. {25}\n",
      "\n",
      "If, as the Romish Clergy teach, even those, who die in the Lord, pass\n",
      "into Purgatory, where they suffer pains equal to those of Hell in\n",
      "intensity and inferior to them only in duration: certainly, such souls\n",
      "can with no truth be said henceforth to rest from their labours.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  In reality, the very notion of a Purgatory stands irreconcileably\n",
      "opposed to the whole scheme and analogy of Scripture.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the doctrine of a Purgatory holds out the speculation: that, _By\n",
      "penal suffering_, _we both may be purified from our sins_, _and likewise\n",
      "may make personal meritorious satisfaction to God for them_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas Scripture teaches us: that _We are justified from our sins by the\n",

      "\n",
      "_When Judas had made a gathering throughout the __company to the sum of\n",
      "two thousand drachms of silver_, _he sent it to Jerusalem_, _to offer a\n",

      "they might be delivered from sin_. {26a}\n",
      "\n",

      "which _praises self-murder_, and which _apologises for its own defects_,\n",
      "{26b} would stand the Latin Priesthood in small stead: for _it never once\n",
      "mentions any Purgatory_; and the persons, moreover, for whom Judas\n",
      "attempted to make reconciliation, were actually men who had died _in the\n",
      "mortal sin of idolatry unrepented of_, and consequently were men who (by\n",

      "\n",
      "III.  From Scripture, let us proceed to the early Fathers of the Church.\n",

      "I.  In the way of _negative_ evidence, Polycarp the disciple of St. John,\n",
      "Athenagoras, and Irenèus, who collectively flourished during a period\n",
      "which extends from the latter end of the first to the latter end of the\n",

      "fellow-labourer of St. Paul, Ignatius the disciple of St. John, Justin\n",
      "Martyr, Hippolytus, and Cyprian, who collectively flourished during a\n",
      "period which extends from the year 63 to the year 258, either by\n",
      "anticipation EXPRESSLY CONTRADICT, or else use language PALPABLY\n",
      "INCOMPATIBLE WITH, the doctrine of a Purgatory. {28a}\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  When this doctrine began to creep into the Church, the individuals,\n",
      "who started it, could not agree among themselves, either as to _its\n",
      "nature_, or as to _its certainty_, or as to _its chronological location_:\n",
      "and, what is sufficiently whimsical, not one among them agreed with the\n",
      "present Church of Rome. {28b}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if the doctrine of a Purgatory had been _uniformly_ and\n",
      "_universally_ and _constantly_ held in the Church Catholic from the very\n",

      "\n",
      "Let it be known and observed (for many are ignorant of the circumstance):\n",
      "that, at the commencement of the practice, supplication was made, not\n",
      "_that souls might be delivered from Purgatory_, but _that they might be\n",
      "partakers of the first resurrection_: {28c} and the notion itself\n",
      "evidently originated from a gratuitous interpretation of a well known\n",
      "obscure text in the Apocalypse. {29a}\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  The unauthorised practice of praying for the dead, under _any_\n",
      "aspect, being thus plainly a mere innovation upon the primitive\n",
      "simplicity of the Gospel; its utility, as we learn from Cyril of\n",
      "Jerusalem, was questioned by MANY, even so late as the middle of the\n",
      "fourth century.  Finding not a vestige of the thing in the whole Bible,\n",
      "and naturally judging that we can know nothing about the matter save from\n",

      "All, therefore, have been glorified and magnified, not through themselves\n",

      "What else can cover our sins, than the righteousness of Christ?  In what\n",

      "sufferings of this time are, in reference to future glory, altogether\n",

      "I.  In exhibiting the tenets of the Romish Church and Clergy on these\n",

      "Trent; the comments of some of the most approved Latin Doctors; and the\n",
      "actual practice of the Romanists themselves as the best explanation of\n",
      "their received tenets.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Let us first hear the decision of the Council of Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "_All Bishops_, _and others who discharge the duty of teaching_, _must\n",
      "diligently instruct the faithful_, _concerning the intercession and\n",
      "invocation of the Saints_, _the honouring of Relics_, _and the legitimate\n",
      "use of Images_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_For this purpose_, _they must teach them_: _that the Saints_, _reigning\n",
      "with Christ_, _offer up their prayers to God for men_; _and that it is\n",
      "good and useful_, _suppliantly to invoke them_, _and to flee to their\n",
      "prayers and assistance for the purpose of obtaining benefits from God\n",
      "through his Son Jesus Christ our Lord who is our only Redeemer and\n",
      "Saviour_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Furthermore_, _they must teach them_: _that those_, _who deny that the\n",
      "Saints in heaven ought to be invoked_, _or who assert either that they do\n",
      "not pray for men or that the invoking of them to pray for us is idolatry\n",
      "or that it is contrary to God’s word and adverse __to the honour of Jesus\n",
      "Christ the only mediator between God and man or that it is foolish by\n",
      "voice or in mind to supplicate those who reign in heaven_, _think\n",
      "impiously_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_They must also teach them_: _that the holy bodies of the Saints and\n",
      "Martyrs and others living with Christ are to be venerated by the\n",
      "faithful_, _through which many benefits are afforded from God to men_;\n",
      "_so that the affirmers_, _that veneration and honour are not due to the\n",
      "Relics of the Saints_, _or that these and other sacred monuments are\n",
      "uselessly honoured by the faithful_, _or that it is vain to celebrate the\n",
      "memories of the Saints for the purpose of obtaining their assistance_,\n",
      "_are wholly to be condemned_, _as the Church long since condemned and\n",
      "still condemns them_.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Likewise_, _they must teach them_: _that the Images of Christ and of the\n",
      "Virgin Mother of God and of the other Saints are especially to be had and\n",
      "retained in Churches_, _and that due honour and veneration are to be paid\n",
      "to them_; _not that any divinity or virtue_, _on account of which they\n",
      "ought to be worshipped_, _is believed to be inherent in them_; _or that\n",
      "any thing is to be sought from them_; _or that trust is to be placed in\n",
      "Images_, _as was formerly done by the Gentiles_, _who placed their hope\n",
      "in Idols_; _but because the honour_, _which is paid to them_, _is\n",
      "referred to the originals which they represent_; _so that_, _through the\n",
      "Images which we kiss and before which we uncover our heads and bow down\n",
      "prostrate_, _we adore Christ and venerate the Saints whose similitude\n",
      "they bear_. {45}\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Let us next, upon the doctrinal and practical system of the\n",
      "professedly unchangeable Church of Rome, hear the comments of some of the\n",
      "most approved Latin Doctors both before and after the Council of Trent.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  From Thomas Aquinas, who was not only a mighty Schoolman but also a\n",
      "canonised Saint of the Roman Church, we may clearly hope to derive the\n",
      "very best and most accurate instruction as to the _real_ tenets of his\n",
      "Communion.  Now this writer, through the medium of a syllogism\n",
      "professedly framed upon an _authorised_ Prayer in the Breviary,\n",
      "establishes the DUTY of worshipping the cross with the self-same\n",
      "adoration as that which is paid to the Deity.\n",
      "\n",
      "_We offer the supreme adoration of Latria to that Being_, _in whom we\n",
      "place our hope of salvation_.  _But we place our hope of salvation in the\n",
      "cross of Christ_: _for the Church sings_; _Hail_, _O cross_, _our only\n",
      "hope in this time of passion_, _increase righteousness to the pious_,\n",
      "_and grant pardon to the guilty_.  THEREFORE _the cross of Christ is to\n",
      "be adored with the supreme adoration of Latria_. {46a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  Much wholesome instruction, in regard to the legitimate use of\n",
      "Images, may also be derived from the expositorial comment of James\n",
      "Naclantus Bishop of Clugium.\n",
      "\n",
      "_We must not only confess_, _that the faithful in the Church worship\n",
      "before an Image_; _as some over-squeamish souls might peradventure\n",
      "express themselves_: _but we must furthermore confess_, _without the\n",
      "slightest scruple of conscience_, _that_ THEY ADORE THE VERY IMAGE\n",
      "ITSELF; _for_, _in sooth_, _they venerate it with the identical worship\n",
      "wherewith they venerate its prototype_.  _Hence_, IF THEY ADORE THE\n",
      "PROTOTYPE WITH THAT DIVINE WORSHIP WHICH IS RENDERED TO GOD AND WHICH\n",
      "TECHNICALLY BEARS THE NAME OF LATRIA, THEY ADORE ALSO THE IMAGE WITH THE\n",
      "SAME LATRIA OR SUPREME DIVINE WORSHIP: _and_, _if they adore the\n",
      "prototype with Dulia or Hyperdulia_, _they are bound also to adore the\n",
      "Image with the self-same species of inferior worship_. {46b}\n",
      "\n",
      "(3.)  In exactly the same expository strain proceeds Gabriel Biel, in his\n",
      "Lectures upon the Canon of the Mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "_If there shall be Images of Christ_, THEY ARE ADORED WITH THE SAME\n",
      "SPECIES OF ADORATION AS CHRIST HIMSELF, THAT IS, WITH THE SUPREME\n",
      "ADORATION CALLED LATRIA: _if_, _of the most blessed Virgin_; _with the\n",
      "worship of Hyperdulia_. {47a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(4.)  The commentary of Peter de Medrano will throw yet additional light\n",
      "on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "_We must say_: _that_, _to our Lady the Mother of God_, _there has been\n",
      "granted the remarkable privilege of being physically and really present\n",
      "in some of her statues or images_.—_Hence we must piously believe_:\n",
      "_that_, _in some celebrated statues or images of herself_, _she is\n",
      "inherent and present_, _personally_, _physically_, _and really_;—_in\n",
      "order that_, _in them_, _she may receive_, _from faithful worshippers_,\n",
      "_her due adoration_. {47b}\n",
      "\n",
      "(5.)  Yet still further light breaks in upon us from the statements of\n",
      "Aringhi, penned and published at Rome under the very nose of the\n",
      "sovereign Pontiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "_This Image_, _translated from the city of Edessa_, _is at once preserved\n",
      "as a bulwark against mad Image-breakers_, _and is set forth to be taken\n",
      "up and_ ADORED _by the faithful_. {47c}\n",
      "\n",
      "_Within these few years_, _under every Pope successively_, _some or other\n",
      "of our sacred Images_, _especially of the more ancient_, _have made\n",
      "themselves illustrious_, _and have acquired_ A PECULIAR WORSHIP AND\n",
      "VENERATION, _by the exhibition of fresh miracles_; _as it is notorious to\n",
      "all_, _who dwell in this city_. {47d}\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Let us finally attend to the actual liturgical practice of the\n",
      "Romanists themselves, as the best explanation of the tenets received and\n",
      "inculcated by their Clergy: for, clearly, as men are taught to believe\n",
      "and to act, so will their authorised public prayers be constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  Hail, O cross, our only hope in this time of passion: increase\n",
      "righteousness to the pious, and grant pardon to the guilty. {48a}\n",

      "the mournful. {48b}\n",
      "\n",
      "(3.)  O singular Virgin, mild among all, make us, being delivered from\n",
      "our sins, mild and chaste.  Grant us purity of life; prepare for us a\n",
      "safe journey: that, seeing Jesus, we may always jointly rejoice. {48c}\n",
      "\n",
      "(4.)  Mary, mother of grace, mother of mercy, do thou protect us from the\n",
      "enemy, and receive us in the hour of death.  Unloose their bonds to the\n",
      "guilty: give light to the blind: drive away our evils: demand all good\n",
      "things.  Shew thyself to be a mother.  Let him, who for us endured to be\n",
      "thy son, receive our prayers through thee. {48d}\n",
      "\n",
      "(5.)  O George, illustrious martyr, praise and glory become thee.—We\n",
      "beseech thee, in our inmost heart, that, with all the faithful, we may be\n",
      "joined to the citizens of heaven, being washed from our impurities. {48e}\n",
      "\n",
      "(6.)  O martyr Christopher, for the honour of the Saviour, make us in\n",
      "mind worthy of the honour of the Deity.  According to the promise of\n",
      "Christ, for what thou askest thou obtainest, grant unto thy sorrowful\n",
      "people the gifts, which in dying thou besoughtest. {48f}\n",
      "\n",
      "(7.)  O ye eleven thousand glorious girls, lilies of virginity, roses of\n",
      "martyrdom, defend me in life by granting me your assistance: and shew\n",
      "yourselves in death, by bringing the last comfort. {48g}\n",
      "\n",
      "(8.)  O holy Mary; our sovereign queen, as God the Father, by his\n",
      "omnipotence, has made thee most powerful; so assist us, at the hour of\n",
      "death, by defending us against all power that is contrary to thine.\n",
      "_Hail_, _Mary_!  O holy Mary, our sovereign queen, as God the Son has\n",
      "endowed thee with so much knowledge and charity that it enlightens all\n",
      "heaven; so, in the hour of death, illustrate and strengthen our souls\n",
      "with the knowledge of the true faith, that they may not be perverted by\n",
      "error or pernicious ignorance.  _Hail_, _Mary_!  O holy Virgin, our\n",
      "sovereign queen, as the Holy Ghost has plentifully poured forth into thee\n",
      "the love of God; so instil into us, at the hour of death, the sweetness\n",
      "of divine love, that all bitterness at that time may become acceptable\n",
      "and pleasant to us.  _Hail_, _Mary_! {49a}\n",

      "been given both in heaven and in earth! {49b}\n",
      "\n",
      "II.  After this ample statement of the doctrine and practice of the Roman\n",
      "Church, it will be useful for us to observe, both _negatively_ what the\n",
      "Bible _does not_ say, and _positively_ what the Bible _does_ say, on the\n",
      "subject now before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  In the first place, then, so far as respects the _negative_ part of\n",
      "the question, the Bible is TOTALLY SILENT, as to the Trent-inculcated\n",
      "duty, of invoking Saints, venerating Relics, and kissing and uncovering\n",
      "the head and falling prostrate before Images either in nitches or upon\n",
      "crucifixes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It NO WHERE recognises or recommends any such practices and notions: as\n",
      "those, of invoking dead Saints, to aid us by their prayers, or to grant\n",
      "us purity of life, or to unloose the bands of the guilty, or to make us\n",
      "mild and chaste, or to defend us in life, or to assist us in the hour of\n",
      "death; of celebrating their memories, for the avowed purpose of obtaining\n",
      "their help and protection; of much benefit being derived, from God to man\n",
      "by the veneration of Relics; of worshipping Christ and venerating the\n",
      "Saints, through the medium of worship and veneration paid relatively to\n",
      "Images; of beseeching the cross, a mere dumb piece of wood even if any of\n",
      "its remains should now be actually in existence, to increase\n",
      "righteousness to the pious and to grant pardon to the guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "From beginning to end, NOT A SYLLABLE of sanction or approbation, in\n",
      "regard to any such phantasies can we discover in the Holy Scriptures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, even to say the very least of the matter, the doctrine, avowedly\n",
      "taught and liturgically introduced by the Church of Rome, has not the\n",
      "slightest support or warrant from the Written Word of God.  Whatever be\n",
      "the ground, upon which it rests: at all events, it clearly rests _not_\n",
      "upon the Bible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  But this is not all.  For, in the second place, so far as respects\n",

      "modified or palliated by the closely harmonizing distinctions and\n",
      "definitions of Paganism and Popery: inasmuch as the Pagans, though\n",
      "slanderously misrepresented by the doctors of the Council of Trent, did\n",
      "in truth defend their Idol-worship against the primitive Christians, on\n",
      "the self-same plea and principle of _relative adoration_, as the said\n",

      "were amply sufficient; for no man can be justly required to admit an\n",
      "alleged fact, without so much as a shadow of historical substantiation.\n",
      "_Positively_, we can say: that, in the writers of the three first ages,\n",
      "not only is there no testimony to be found _for_ the asserted fact of\n",
      "_Peter’s diocesan Roman Episcopate_, but we are absolutely encountered\n",
      "with direct testimony _against_ it.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  Irenèus of Lyons, who lived from the latter end of the first\n",
      "century to the latter end of the second, distinctly attests: that _the\n",
      "Church of Rome was_ JOINTLY _founded by the_ TWO _Apostles Peter and\n",
      "Paul_; and that, _When the_ TWO _Apostles had thus_ JOINTLY _founded it_,\n",
      "_they_ JOINTLY _delivered the Episcopate of their newly founded Society\n",
      "to Linus_.  Accordingly, in strict agreement with this account of the\n",
      "transaction, Irenèus places Linus the FIRST in his list of the twelve\n",
      "successive Roman Bishops, who governed that Church, from the time of its\n",
      "original joint foundation by Peter and Paul, down to the year 175 when he\n",
      "published his Work against Heresies. {58a}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now such an account is plainly incompatible with the pretended fact: that\n",
      "_Peter was the first diocesan Bishop of Rome_.  For the account states:\n",
      "that _Peter and Paul_, _having jointly founded the Roman Churchy\n",
      "committed the episcopate of it to Linus_.  Whence it dearly follows: that\n",
      "the first diocesan Bishop of Rome was _Linus_, not _Peter_.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  The evidence of Irenèus is directly confirmed by the ancient author\n",
      "of the Apostolical Constitutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gives us a list of the primitive apostolically ordained Bishops: and,\n",
      "in the course of it, he unequivocally states, even in so many words, that\n",

      "_propound the doctrine of Transubstantiation_, _that_, _on the part of\n",

      "to PRACTICE.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The first specimen, which I shall give, is that, afforded by the\n",
      "Douay Doctors themselves, and afterward very greatly improved upon by the\n",
      "dexterous Bossuet Bishop of Meaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bertram of Corby, always admitted to be an orthodox catholic divine, had\n",
      "written, in the ninth century, a book on the Eucharist; which, in its\n",
      "natural construction, is plainly fatal to the doctrine of\n",
      "Transubstantiation. {63b}\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereupon, the Professors of Douay state; that Bertram’s book, when\n",
      "_emendated_, may be tolerated: observing with perfect truth, that, since\n",
      "they had kindly done the good office of _emendation_ for sundry other\n",
      "ancient catholic writers, no imaginable reason could be assigned, why\n",
      "Bertram, in all equity, should not deserve and receive _the same diligent\n",
      "recognition_. {64a}\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous copies of the Work, however, escaped the ambiguous benefit of\n",
      "the Douay _emendation_.  Bossuet, therefore, as in such cases the\n",
      "Professors wisely direct, finally judged it best to affix to Bertram’s\n",
      "undeniable phraseology _some convenient sense_.  Hence, in settling the\n",
      "merits of the eucharistic controversy between Paschase and Bertram, the\n",
      "Bishop of Meaux compendiously assures us: that these two champions, with\n",
      "their respective followers, were all alike staunch Transubstantialists,\n",
      "though they unluckily differed as to the best mode of expressing and\n",
      "propounding their common favourite doctrine. {64b}\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Another specimen occurs in the remarkable case of Elfric’s Epistle to\n",
      "Wulfstane, written about the close of the tenth century.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Saxon, luckily preserved in the library of Exeter Cathedral,\n",
      "contains a passage flat against Transubstantiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Nevertheless_, _this sacrifice is_, NOT _the same body of his wherein he\n",
      "suffered for us_, NOR _the same blood which he shed for us_: _but_,\n",
      "SPIRITUALLY, _it is made his body and blood_; AS _was that manna which\n",
      "rained from heaven_, _and_ AS _was that water which did flow out of the\n",
      "rock_. {64c}\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, in the Latin translation of the Epistle contained in the library of\n",
      "Worcester Cathedral, this passage, the decisive strength of which was\n",
      "evidently felt and tacitly acknowledged, has been carefully _erased_.\n",
      "{64d}\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  The treatment of the writings of Theodoret will afford us yet a third\n",
      "specimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Father, who lived in the fifth century, had expressed himself so\n",
      "strongly against the doctrine now denominated _Transubstantiation_, that\n",

      "temper, tore out and burned the guilty leaf which contained the passage.\n",
      "{65a}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now such a summary process might _emendate_ John Clement’s individual\n",
      "copy of Theodoret: but, unluckily, other copies were abroad in the world.\n",
      "What, then, was to be done?  Why, truly, as the Douay Doctors advise in\n",
      "such cases, _a commodious sense_, by dint of _excogitating a comment_,\n",
      "must be affixed to the noxious passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodoret, avowedly opposing the phantasy of Transubstantiation, had\n",
      "written, concerning the eucharistic bread and wine _after_ consecration,\n",
      "that _they remain in their former_ SUBSTANCE _and shape and appearance_.\n",
      "{65b}\n",
      "\n",
      "But three modern Romish Doctors, Mr. Berington, Bp. Trevern of\n",
      "Strasbourg, and Mr. Husenbeth, _excogitating a more commodious sense_\n",
      "which never occurred to John Clement, make Theodoret say, in despite both\n",
      "of greek grammar and clear context, that _the_ consecrated bread and wine\n",
      "_remain in the shape and form of the former_ SUBSTANCE. {65c}\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this translation, as every schoolboy who reads the original Greek\n",
      "will at once perceive, is _grammatically impossible_.  But let that\n",
      "original be withheld from the gaze of the curious: and ten to one but\n",
      "_the commodious sense_ will pass muster among the Romish Laity, nay even\n",
      "among some of the Protestant Laity, without any further difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  A fourth specimen is yet again afforded by the liberality of the same\n",
      "Bp. Trevern of Strasbourg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of a _moral_, not of a _literal_ or _substantial_, change in the\n",
      "consecrated elements, as they themselves distinctly assure us in the way\n",
      "of explaining their own language, the old Fathers often say: that _the\n",
      "bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ_.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bp. Trevern, by deliberately in more than a single instance\n",
      "_interpolating_ the decisive word SUBSTANCE, while from the eyes of his\n",
      "readers he carefully withholds the originals, makes them speak, not their\n",
      "own sentiments, but those of the Church and Clergy of Rome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, when Cyril of Jerusalem writes; _Whatsoever the Holy Spirit hath\n",
      "touched_, _that thing is sanctified and changed_: Bp. Trevern forces him\n",
      "to say; _All that_, _which has received the impression of the Holy\n",
      "Spirit_, _is sanctified and changed_ INTO ANOTHER SUBSTANCE. {66a}\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, when the old author of the Treatise on the Sacraments in the\n",
      "Works of Ambrose writes; _They are changed into other_: Bp. Trevern\n",
      "remorselessly compels him to say; _They pass into another_ SUBSTANCE.\n",
      "{66b}\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  For our fifth specimen we are indebted jointly to Bp. Trevern and Mr.\n",
      "Berington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyprian speaks of men being _cleansed for sins through the suffering of\n",
      "long pain_ and of their being _long purged in fire_. {66c}\n",
      "\n",
      "These expressions, as the whole context shews and as it was rightly\n",
      "observed by the honest romish commentator Rigaltius, relate simply to the\n",
      "allegorical fire of penitential austerities in _this_ world: a fire, in\n",
      "which, by the early discipline of the Church, it was required, that the\n",
      "lapsed should for an appointed season be exercised.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bp. Trevern and Mr. Berington, wholly _suppressing_ the context and\n",
      "_saying not a single syllable_ about their respectable fellow-religionist\n",
      "Rigaltius, gravely adduce the passage as proof positive: that _Cyprian_,\n",
      "_in the middle of the third century_, _held and taught the existence of a\n",
      "Purgatory after death in the next world_. {67}\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  Our sixth specimen is afforded by Mr. Husenbeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The famous text in the Gospel of St. Matthew, which exhibits our Lord as\n",
      "saying, _Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church_, is\n",
      "universally explained by the Romish Clergy, as being _a grant from Christ\n",
      "of a monarchal supremacy in the Catholic Church_, _both to Peter\n",
      "individually_, _and to Peter’s alleged heirs and successors the Bishops\n",
      "of Rome_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, most unluckily for this current explanation, the primitive\n",
      "theologians knew nothing of it: for, while the early Fathers, Justin and\n",
      "Tertullian and Cyprian and Origen and Athanasius and Jerome and Augustine\n",
      "and Chrysostom and Hilary, differ as to the true meaning of the text\n",
      "(some supposing the rock to be Peter personally and exclusively; some, to\n",
      "be Christ himself; and some, to be Peter’s confession of Christ’s\n",
      "divinity); NOT ONE of them interprets it, as the Romish Clergy would now\n",
      "interpret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, by way of putting to open shame every opponent of the Pope’s\n",
      "supremacy by divine right, Mr. Husenbeth deliberately assures his plain\n",
      "country readers: that, _by_ ALL _the holy Fathers and Doctors_, _by_ ALL\n",
      "_the Councils_, _and by the most learned and pious men in the world in_\n",
      "EVERY _age down to the Reformation_, _the text in question has been_\n",
      "UNIFORMLY _understood as it is now explained by the Romish Clergy_. {68a}\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  The copiousness of Mr. Husenbeth will afford us also yet a seventh\n",
      "specimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "With every semblance of even scrupulous fidelity, giving distinct\n",
      "references to his authorities, this theologian, in a small Work written\n",

      "state, from the testimony of my own eye-sight, that NOT ONE _of those\n",

      "of that See_.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  Our eighth specimen is furnished by the joint industry and rival\n",
      "intrepidity of Bp. Trevern and Mr. Husenbeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of persuading the unwary, that _the highest divine\n",
      "adoration of the consecrated bread and wine had been the practice of the\n",
      "Church from the earliest ages_, Bp. Trevern adduces a direction or rubric\n",
      "from the ancient Clementine Liturgy: and, after him, Mr. Husenbeth\n",
      "eagerly catches up, for the same purpose, the same ancient rubric or\n",
      "direction. {69a}\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile the direction itself, in its _genuine_ state says not a\n",
      "syllable respecting _any_ adoration of the consecrated bread and wine.\n",
      "Bp. Trevern first _interpolates_ it, to make it serve his purpose: and\n",
      "then Mr. Husenbeth brings forward, _as evidence_, the precise words of\n",
      "the gallican prelates _interpolation_ wedged into an utterly false\n",
      "construction of the original passage. {69b}\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  Our ninth and last specimen is of a somewhat wholesale nature: whence\n",
      "it will the more completely exemplify the PRINCIPLE, laid down, for the\n",
      "better furtherance of truth, by the painful Professors of Douay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King of Spain (I avail myself of the diligent researches of our own\n",
      "excellent Bishop Jeremy Taylor) gave a commission to the Inquisitors, to\n",
      "_purge_ all catholic authors: but with this special clause; that _they\n",

      "about thirteen years after, a copy of it was procured and published by\n",
      "Johannes Pappus and Franciscus Junius.  This circumstance compelled the\n",
      "Inquisitors to acknowledge their expurgatory index: and they have since\n",
      "printed it themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1.)  Let us now observe some few of the exploits of _emendation_,\n",
      "achieved by these honest and laborious correctors of erring Antiquity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chrysostom’s Works printed at Basil, the words, _There is no merit_,\n",
      "_but what is given us by Christ_, are commanded to be expunged.  Yet\n",
      "these very words occur in his first Homily upon the text of St. John, _Ye\n",
      "are my friends_.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar erasure is enjoined of the clause, _The Church is built_, _not\n",
      "upon the man_, _but upon the faith_.  Yet this clause occurs in his\n",
      "Sermonon Pentecost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same _expurgatory process_ has been undergone by Chrysostom in many\n",
      "other places: and Ambrose and Augustine and the rest of the old Fathers\n",
      "have been subjected to the like necessary _emendations_.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short the _curtailments_ of the ancient writers were carried to so\n",
      "great an extent, that Ludovicus Saurius, the corrector of the press at\n",
      "Lyons, shewed and complained of them to Junius: lamenting, that he was\n",
      "forced to cancel and erase many sayings of Ambrose in that edition of his\n",
      "Works which was printed at Lyons in the year 1559.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2.)  Not content with thus _emendating_ the Fathers, our pains-taking\n",
      "Inquisitors, in order that their editions might throughout be perfectly\n",
      "harmonious and consistent, fell doggedly to work upon the very tables or\n",
      "indexes, which contained any references to the expunged passages: for, of\n",
      "course, it were unseemly, that a reference should appear, indicating the\n",
      "occurrence of a place which _itself_ could no where be found in an\n",
      "improved or expurgated edition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, out of one of Froben’s indexes, they have directed the erasure of\n",
      "the following references: _The use of images forbidden_; _The Eucharist\n",
      "no sacrifice_, _but the commemoration of a sacrifice_; _Works_, _although\n",
      "they do not justify_, _yet are necessary to salvation_; _Marriage is\n",
      "granted to all that will not contain_; _Venial sins damn_; _The dead\n",
      "Saints_, _after this life_, _cannot help us_.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, out of the index of Augustine’s Works by Claudius Chevallonius\n",
      "at Paris in the year 1531, they have commanded a still more extraordinary\n",
      "erasure of a reference: _Dele_, _Solus Deus adorandus_; that is, _Blot\n",
      "out the words_, _God alone is to be adored_. {71a}\n",
      "\n",
      "(3.)  On such disgraceful practices, Bp. Taylor well remarks: _These\n",
      "instances may serve_, _instead of multitudes which might be brought_, _of\n",
      "their corrupting the witnesses and razing the records of antiquity_,\n",
      "_that the errors and novelties of the Church of Rome might not be so\n",
      "easily reproved_.  _Now_, _if the Fathers were not against them_, _what\n",
      "need these arts_?  _Why should they use them thus_?  _Their own\n",
      "expurgatory indices me infinite testimony against them_, _both that they\n",
      "do so_, _and that they need it_. {71b}\n",
      "\n",
      "III.  It were easy to have multiplied specimens of the same description:\n",
      "but these, I apprehend, may well suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respecting such a topic, any observations of my own are quite\n",
      "superfluous.  By some marvellous perversion of the moral sense, Sixtus\n",

      "diligent care, that the writings of all catholic authors, and more\n",

      "emaculated_: but the plain good sense of every upright and honourable man\n",
      "will deem such praise no very flattering compliment. {71c}\n",

      "Yet, though I shall not weary the prudent inquirer with any needless\n",
      "remarks of my own, either on the Douay Principle itself, or on the\n",
      "reduction of that principle to systematic practice: I may, at parting, be\n",
      "permitted, in all good will, to offer him a word of not altogether\n",
      "useless advice.\n",

      "Whenever a Romish Doctor makes a large or extraordinary or startling\n",

      "\n",
      "I.  Upon those who _assert_, rests the duty and incumbency of _proof_.\n",
      "Yet, in regard to what by a single comprehensive word may be styled\n",
      "_Popery_, the question stands _negatively_, in manner following.\n",
      "\n",
      "_The peculiar doctrines and practices_, _which the Clergy of the Roman\n",

      "PREFACE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time since the American occupation of the Islands,\n",
      "Philippine folk-tales have appeared in scientific publications, but\n",
      "never, so far as the writer is aware, has there been an attempt to\n",
      "offer to the general public a comprehensive popular collection of\n",
      "this material. It is my earnest hope that this collection of tales\n",
      "will give those who are interested opportunity to learn something\n",
      "of the magic, superstitions, and weird customs of the Filipinos,\n",
      "and to feel the charm of their wonder-world as it is pictured by\n",
      "these dark-skinned inhabitants of our Island possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In company with my husband, who was engaged in ethnological work for\n",
      "the Field Museum of Natural History, it was my good fortune to spend\n",
      "four years among the wild tribes of the Philippines, During this\n",
      "time we frequently heard these stories, either related by the people\n",
      "in their homes and around the camp fires or chanted by the pagan\n",
      "priests in communion with the spirits. The tales are now published\n",
      "in this little volume, with the addition of a few folk-legends\n",
      "that have appeared in the _Journal of American Folk-Lore_ and in\n",
      "scientific publications, here retold with some additions made by\n",
      "native story-tellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have endeavored to select typical tales from tribes widely separated\n",
      "and varying in culture from savagery to a rather high degree of\n",
      "development. The stories are therefore divided into five groups,\n",
      "as follows: Tinguian, Igorot, the Wild Tribes of Mindanao, Moro,\n",
      "and Christian,\n",
      "\n",
      "The first two groups, Tinguian and Igorot, are from natives who\n",
      "inhabit the rugged mountain region of northwestern Luzon. From time\n",
      "immemorial they have been zealous head-hunters, and the stories teem\n",
      "with references to customs and superstitions connected with their\n",
      "savage practices. By far the largest number belong to the Tinguian\n",
      "group. In order to appreciate these tales to the fullest extent,\n",
      "we must understand the point of view of the Tinguian. To him they\n",
      "embody all the known traditions of \"the first times\"--of the people\n",
      "who inhabited the earth before the present race appeared, of the\n",
      "ancient heroes and their powers and achievements. In them he finds\n",
      "an explanation of and reason for many of his present laws and customs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A careful study of the whole body of Tinguian mythology points to\n",
      "the conclusion that the chief characters of these tales are not\n",
      "celestial beings but typical, generalized heroes of former ages,\n",
      "whose deeds have been magnified in the telling by many generations\n",
      "of their descendants. These people of \"the first times\" practiced\n",
      "magic. They talked with jars, created human beings out of betel-nuts,\n",
      "raised the dead, and had the power of changing themselves into other\n",
      "forms. This, however, does not seem strange or impossible to the\n",
      "Tinguian of today, for even now they talk with jars, perform certain\n",
      "rites to bring sickness and death to their foes, and are warned by\n",
      "omens received through the medium of birds, thunder and lightning,\n",
      "or the condition of the liver of a slaughtered animal. They still\n",
      "converse freely with certain spirits who during religious ceremonies\n",
      "are believed to use the bodies of men or women as mediums for the\n",
      "purpose of advising and instructing the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of the characters appear in story after story. Sometimes they\n",
      "go under different names, but in the minds of the story-tellers their\n",
      "personality and relationships are definitely established. Thus Ini-init\n",
      "of the first tale becomes Kadayadawan in the second, Aponitolau in\n",
      "the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, and Ligi in the seventh. Kanag,\n",
      "the son of Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen, in the fifth tale is called\n",
      "Dumalawi.\n",
      "\n",
      "These heroes had most unusual relations with the heavenly bodies,\n",
      "all of which seem to have been regarded as animate beings. In the\n",
      "fourth tale Aponitolau marries Gaygayoma, the star maiden who is\n",
      "the daughter of the big star and the moon. In the first story the\n",
      "same character under the name of Ini-init seems to be a sun-god:\n",
      "we are told that he is \"the sun,\" and again \"a round stone which\n",
      "rolls.\" Thereupon we might conclude that he is a true solar being;\n",
      "yet in the other tales of this collection and in many more known to\n",
      "the Tinguian he reveals no celestial qualities. Even in the first\n",
      "story he abandons his place in the sky and goes to live on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first eight stories we read of many customs of \"the first\n",
      "times\" which differ radically from those of the present. But a careful\n",
      "analysis of all the known lore of this people points to the belief that\n",
      "many of these accounts depict a period when similar customs did exist\n",
      "among the people, or else were practiced by emigrants who generations\n",
      "ago became amalgamated with the Tinguian and whose strange customs\n",
      "finally became attributed to the people of the tales. The stories\n",
      "numbered nine to sixteen are of a somewhat different type, and in\n",
      "them the Tinguian finds an explanation of many things, such as,\n",
      "how the people learned to plant, and to cure diseases, where they\n",
      "secured the valuable jars and beads, and why the moon has spots on\n",
      "its face. All these stories are fully believed, the beads and jars\n",
      "are considered precious, and the places mentioned are definitely\n",
      "known. While the accounts seem to be of fairly recent origin they\n",
      "conflict neither with the fundamental ideas and traditions of \"the\n",
      "first times\" nor with the beliefs of today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stories seventeen to twenty-three are regarded as fables and are told\n",
      "to amuse the children or to while away the midday hours when the people\n",
      "seek shaded spots to lounge or stop on the trail to rest. Most of\n",
      "them are known to the Christianized tribes throughout the Islands and\n",
      "show great similarity to the tales found in the islands to the south\n",
      "and, in some cases, in Europe. In many of them the chief incidents\n",
      "are identical with those found elsewhere, but the story-tellers, by\n",
      "introducing old customs and beliefs, have moulded and colored them\n",
      "until they reflect the common ideas of the Tinguian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third group includes stories from several wild tribes who dwell\n",
      "in the large island of Mindanao. Here are people who work in brass\n",
      "and steel, build good dwellings, and wear hemp clothing elaborately\n",
      "decorated with beads, shell disks, and embroidery, but who still\n",
      "practice many savage customs, including slavery and human sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth division gives two tales from the Moro (hardy Malayan\n",
      "warriors whose ancestors early became converts to the faith of\n",
      "Mohammed). Their teachers were the Arabian traders who, about 1400,\n",
      "succeeded in converting many of the Malay Islanders to the faith of\n",
      "the prophet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last group contains the stories of the Christianized natives--those\n",
      "who accepted the rule of Spain and with it the Catholic religion. Their\n",
      "tales, while full of local color, nevertheless show the influence\n",
      "of the European tutors. They furnish an excellent opportunity to\n",
      "contrast the literature of the savage head-hunters with that of the\n",
      "Moro and Christian tribes and to observe how various recent influences\n",
      "have modified the beliefs of people who not many centuries ago were\n",
      "doubtless of a uniform grade of culture. It is interesting, too, to\n",
      "note that European tales brought into the Islands by Mohammedan and\n",
      "Christian rulers and traders have been worked over until, at first\n",
      "glance, they now appear indigenous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Owing to local coloring, these tales have various forms. Still we\n",
      "find many incidents which are held in common by all the tribes of\n",
      "the Archipelago and even by the people of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and\n",
      "India. Some of these similarities and parallelisms are indicated in\n",
      "the foot-notes throughout the book.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The dim light of stars filtered through the leafy canopy above us,\n",
      "and the shadowy form of our guide once more appeared at my horse's\n",
      "head. It was only for an instant, however, and then we were plunged\n",
      "again into the inky darkness of a tropical jungle.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had planned to reach the distant Tinguian village in the late\n",
      "afternoon, but had failed to reckon with the deliberateness of native\n",
      "carriers. It was only by urging our horses that we were able to\n",
      "ford the broad Abra ere the last rays of the sun dropped behind the\n",
      "mountains. And then, in this land of no twilights, night had settled\n",
      "quickly over us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had made our way up the mountain-side, through the thick jungle,\n",
      "only to find that the trail, long imperceptible to us, had escaped\n",
      "even the keen eyes of our guide. For several hours we wandered about,\n",
      "lost in the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "On and on we went, through narrow paths, steep in places, and made\n",
      "rough and dangerous by sharp rocks as well as by those long creepers\n",
      "of the jungle whose thorny fingers are ever ready to seize horse or\n",
      "rider. Occasionally we came out of the forest, only to cross rocky\n",
      "mountain streams; or perhaps it was the same stream that we crossed\n",
      "many times. Our horses, becoming weary and uncertain of foot, grew more\n",
      "and more reluctant to plunge into the dark, swiftly flowing water. And\n",
      "our patience was nearly exhausted when we at last caught sight of\n",
      "dim lights in the valley below. Half an hour later we rode into Manabo.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall never forget that first picture. It was a weird\n",
      "spectacle. Coming out of the darkness, we were almost convinced that\n",
      "we had entered a new world. Against the blackness of the night,\n",
      "grass-roofed houses stood outlined in the dim light of a bonfire;\n",
      "and squatting around that fire, unclad save for gay blankets wrapped\n",
      "about their shoulders, were brown-skinned men smoking long pipes,\n",
      "while women bedecked with bright beads were spinning cotton. As they\n",
      "worked in the flickering light, they stretched their distaffs at\n",
      "arm's length into the air like witches waving their wands; and with\n",
      "that the elfland picture was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the stillness of the night a single voice could be heard reciting\n",
      "some tale in a singsong tone, which was interrupted only when peals\n",
      "of laughter burst forth from the listeners, or when a scrawny dog rose\n",
      "to bark at an imaginary noise until the shouts of the men quieted him\n",
      "and he returned to his bed in the warm ashes. Later we learned that\n",
      "these were the regular social gatherings of the Tinguian, and every\n",
      "night during the dry season one or more of these bonfires were to be\n",
      "seen in the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we had attained to the footing of welcome guests in these\n",
      "circles, we found that a good story-teller was always present,\n",
      "and, while the men smoked, the women spun, and the dogs slept,\n",
      "he entertained us with tales of heroes who knew the magic of the\n",
      "betel-nut, or with stories of spirits and their power over the lives\n",
      "of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are some of the tales heard first around the camp fire\n",
      "of the distant mountain village.\n",

      "\n",
      "One day Aponibolinayen and her sister-in-law went out to gather\n",
      "greens. They walked to the woods to the place where the siksiklat grew,\n",
      "for the tender leaves of this vine are very good to eat. Suddenly while\n",
      "searching about in the underbrush, Aponibolinayen cried out with joy,\n",
      "for she had found the vine, and she started to pick the leaves. Pull\n",
      "as hard as she would, however, the leaves did not come loose, and all\n",
      "at once the vine wound itself around her body and began carrying her\n",
      "upward. [1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Far up through the air she went until she reached the sky, and there\n",
      "the vine set her down under a tree. Aponibolinayen was so surprised\n",
      "to find herself in the sky that for some time she just sat and looked\n",
      "around, and then, hearing a rooster crow, she arose to see if she\n",
      "could find it. Not far from where she had sat was a beautiful spring\n",
      "surrounded by tall betel-nut trees whose tops were pure gold. Rare\n",
      "beads were the sands of the spring, and the place where the women set\n",
      "their jars when they came to dip water was a large golden plate. As\n",
      "Aponibolinayen stood admiring the beauties of this spring, she beheld\n",
      "a small house nearby, and she was filled with fear lest the owner\n",
      "should find her there. She looked about for some means of escape and\n",
      "finally climbed to the top of a betel-nut tree and hid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the owner of this house was Ini-init, [2] the Sun, but he was\n",
      "never at home in the daylight, for it was his duty to shine in the\n",
      "sky and give light to all the world. At the close of the day when\n",
      "the Big Star took his place in the sky to shine through the night,\n",
      "Ini-init returned to his house, but early the next morning he was\n",
      "always off again.\n",
      "\n",
      "From her place in the top of the betel-nut tree, Aponibolinayen saw\n",
      "the Sun when he came home at evening time, and again the next morning\n",
      "she saw him leave. When she was sure that he was out of sight she\n",
      "climbed down and entered his dwelling, for she was very hungry. She\n",
      "cooked rice, and into a pot of boiling water she dropped a stick\n",
      "which immediately became fish, [3] so that she had all she wished to\n",
      "eat. When she was no longer hungry, she lay down on the bed to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now late in the afternoon Ini-init returned from his work and went\n",
      "to fish in the river near his house, and he caught a big fish. While\n",
      "he sat on the bank cleaning his catch, he happened to look up toward\n",
      "his house and was startled to see that it appeared to be on fire. [4]\n",
      "He hurried home, but when he reached the house he saw that it was\n",
      "not burning at all, and he entered. On his bed he beheld what looked\n",
      "like a flame of fire, but upon going closer he found that it was a\n",
      "beautiful woman fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ini-init stood for some time wondering what he should do, and then\n",
      "he decided to cook some food and invite this lovely creature to eat\n",
      "with him. He put rice over the fire to boil and cut into pieces the\n",
      "fish he had caught. The noise of this awakened Aponibolinayen, and\n",
      "she slipped out of the house and back to the top of the betel-nut\n",
      "tree. The Sun did not see her leave, and when the food was prepared\n",
      "he called her, but the bed was empty and he had to eat alone. That\n",
      "night Ini-init could not sleep well, for all the time he wondered who\n",
      "the beautiful woman could be. The next morning, however, he rose as\n",
      "usual and set forth to shine in the sky, for that was his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day Aponibolinayen stole again to the house of the Sun and cooked\n",
      "food, and when she returned to the betel-nut tree she left rice and\n",
      "fish ready for the Sun when he came home. Late in the afternoon\n",
      "Ini-init went into his home, and when he found pots of hot rice\n",
      "and fish over the fire he was greatly troubled. After he had eaten\n",
      "he walked a long time in the fresh air. \"Perhaps it is done by the\n",
      "lovely woman who looks like a flame of fire,\" he said. \"If she comes\n",
      "again I will try to catch her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day the Sun shone in the sky as before, and when the afternoon\n",
      "grew late he called to the Big Star to hurry to take his place, for he\n",
      "was impatient to reach home. As he drew near the house he saw that it\n",
      "again looked as if it was on fire. He crept quietly up the ladder, and\n",
      "when he had reached the top he sprang in and shut the door behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aponibolinayen, who was cooking rice over the fire, was surprised and\n",
      "angry that she had been caught; but the Sun gave her betel-nut [5]\n",
      "which was covered with gold, and they chewed together and told each\n",
      "other their names. Then Aponibolinayen took up the rice and fish,\n",
      "and as they ate they talked together and became acquainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time Aponibolinayen and the Sun were married, and every\n",
      "morning the Sun went to shine in the sky, and upon his return at night\n",
      "he found his supper ready for him. He began to be troubled, however,\n",
      "to know where the food came from, for though he brought home a fine\n",
      "fish every night, Aponibolinayen always refused to cook it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night he watched her prepare their meal, and he saw that, instead\n",
      "of using the nice fish he had brought, she only dropped a stick into\n",
      "the pot of boiling water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you try to cook a stick?\" asked Ini-init in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that we can have fish to eat,\" answered his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you cook that stick for a month, it will not be soft,\" said\n",
      "Ini-init. \"Take this fish that I caught in the net, for it will\n",
      "be good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aponibolinayen only laughed at him, and when they were ready to\n",
      "eat she took the cover off the pot and there was plenty of nice soft\n",
      "fish. The next night and the next, Aponibolinayen cooked the stick,\n",
      "and Ini-init became greatly troubled for he saw that though the stick\n",
      "always supplied them with fish, it never grew smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally he asked Aponibolinayen again why it was that she cooked the\n",
      "stick instead of the fish he brought, and she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you not know of the woman on earth who has magical power and can\n",
      "change things?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" answered the Sun, \"and now I know that you have great power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" said his wife, \"do not ask again why I cook the stick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And they ate their supper of rice and the fish which the stick made.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night not long after this Aponibolinayen told her husband that\n",
      "she wanted to go with him the next day when he made light in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, you cannot,\" said the Sun, \"for it is very hot up there,\n",
      "[6] and you cannot stand the heat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will take many blankets and pillows,\" said the woman, \"and when\n",
      "the heat becomes very great, I will hide under them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again and again Ini-init begged her not to go, but as often she\n",
      "insisted on accompanying him, and early in the morning they set out,\n",
      "carrying with them many blankets and pillows.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, they went to the East, and as soon as they arrived the Sun began\n",
      "to shine, and Aponibolinayen was with him. They traveled toward the\n",
      "West, but when morning had passed into noontime and they had reached\n",
      "the middle of the sky Aponibolinayen was so hot that she melted and\n",
      "became oil. Then Ini-init put her into a bottle and wrapped her in\n",
      "the blankets and pillows and dropped her down to earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now one of the women of Aponibolinayen's town was at the spring dipping\n",
      "water when she heard something fall near her. Turning to look, she\n",
      "beheld a bundle of beautiful blankets and pillows which she began to\n",
      "unroll, and inside she found the most beautiful woman she had ever\n",
      "seen. Frightened at her discovery, the woman ran as fast as she could\n",
      "to the town, where she called the people together and told them to\n",
      "come at once to the spring. They all hastened to the spot and there\n",
      "they found Aponibolinayen for whom they had been searching everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where have you been?\" asked her father; \"we have searched all over\n",
      "the world and we could not find you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have come from Pindayan,\" answered Aponibolinayen. \"Enemies of\n",
      "our people kept me there till I made my escape while they were asleep\n",
      "at night\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All were filled with joy that the lost one had returned, and they\n",
      "decided that at the next moon [7] they would perform a ceremony for\n",
      "the spirits [8] and invite all the relatives who were mourning for\n",
      "Aponibolinayen.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began to prepare for the ceremony, and while they were\n",
      "pounding rice, Aponibolinayen asked her mother to prick her little\n",
      "finger where it itched, and as she did so a beautiful baby boy popped\n",
      "out. The people were very much surprised at this, and they noticed\n",
      "that every time he was bathed the baby grew very fast so that, in\n",
      "a short time, he was able to walk. Then they were anxious to know\n",
      "who was the husband of Aponibolinayen, but she would not tell them,\n",
      "and they decided to invite everyone in the world to the ceremony that\n",
      "they might not overlook him.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sent for the betel-nuts that were covered with gold, [9] and\n",
      "when they had oiled them they commanded them to go to all the towns\n",
      "and compel the people to come to the ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If anyone refuses to come, grow on his knee,\" said the people,\n",
      "and the betel-nuts departed to do as they were bidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the guests began to arrive, the people watched carefully for one\n",
      "who might be the husband of Aponibolinayen, but none appeared and they\n",
      "were greatly troubled. Finally they went to the old woman, Alokotan,\n",
      "who was able to talk with the spirits, and begged her to find what town\n",
      "had not been visited by the betel-nuts which had been sent to invite\n",
      "the people. After she had consulted the spirits the old woman said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have invited all the people except Ini-init who lives up\n",
      "above. Now you must send a betel-nut to summon him. It may be that\n",
      "he is the husband of Aponibolinayen, for the siksiklat vine carried\n",
      "her up when she went to gather greens.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So a betel-nut was called and bidden to summon Ini-init.\n",
      "\n",
      "The betel-nut went up to the Sun, who was in his house, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, Sun. I have come to summon you to a ceremony which the\n",
      "father and mother of Aponibolinayen are making for the spirits. If\n",
      "you do not want to go, I will grow on your head.\" [10]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grow on my head,\" said the Sun. \"I do not wish to go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the betel-nut jumped upon his head and grew until it became so\n",
      "tall that the Sun was not able to carry it, and he was in great pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, grow on my pig,\" begged the Sun. So the betel-nut jumped upon\n",
      "the pig's head and grew, but it was so heavy that the pig could not\n",
      "carry it and squealed all the time. At last the Sun saw that he would\n",
      "have to obey the summons, and he said to the betel-nut:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get off my pig and I will go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Ini-init came to the ceremony, and as soon as Aponibolinayen and the\n",
      "baby saw him, they were very happy and ran to meet him. Then the people\n",
      "knew that this was the husband of Aponibolinayen, and they waited\n",
      "eagerly for him to come up to them. As he drew near, however, they saw\n",
      "that he did not walk, for he was round; and then they perceived that\n",
      "he was not a man but a large stone. All her relatives were very angry\n",
      "to find that Aponibolinayen had married a stone; and they compelled\n",
      "her to take off her beads [11] and her good clothes, for, they said,\n",
      "she must now dress in old clothes and go again to live with the stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aponibolinayen put on the rags that they brought her and at once\n",
      "set out with the stone for his home. No sooner had they arrived there,\n",
      "however, than he became a handsome man, and they were very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In one moon,\" said the Sun, \"we will make a ceremony for the spirits,\n",
      "and I will pay your father and mother the marriage price [12] for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This pleased Aponibolinayen very much, and they used magic so that\n",
      "they had many neighbors who came to pound rice [13] for them and to\n",
      "build a large spirit house. [14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they sent oiled betel-nuts to summon their relatives to the\n",
      "ceremony. The father of Aponibolinayen did not want to go, but\n",
      "the betel-nut threatened to grow on his knee if he did not. So he\n",
      "commanded all the people in the town to wash their hair and their\n",
      "clothes, and when all was ready they set out.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the town they were greatly surprised to find that\n",
      "the stone had become a man, and they chewed the magic betel-nuts to\n",
      "see who he might be. It was discovered that he was the son of a couple\n",
      "in Aponibolinayen's own town, and the people all rejoiced that this\n",
      "couple had found the son whom they had thought lost. They named him\n",
      "Aponitolau, and his parents paid the marriage price for his wife--the\n",
      "spirit house nine times full of valuable jars. [15]\n",
      "\n",
      "After that all danced and made merry for one moon, and when the people\n",
      "departed for their homes Ini-init and his wife went with them to live\n",
      "on the earth.\n",

      "The most beautiful girl in all the world was Aponibolinayen of\n",
      "Nalpangan. Many young men had come to her brother, Aponibalagen,\n",
      "to ask for her hand in marriage, but he had refused them all, for he\n",
      "awaited one who possessed great power. Then it happened that the fame\n",
      "of her beauty spread over all the world till it reached even to Adasen;\n",
      "and in that place there lived a man of great power named Gawigawen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gawigawen, who was a handsome man, had sought among all the pretty\n",

      "who presently began to prepare food for them. [16]\n",
      "\n",
      "She put the pot over the fire, and when the water boiled she broke\n",
      "up a stick and threw the pieces into the pot, and immediately they\n",
      "became fish. Then she brought basi [17] in a large jar, and Dinawagen,\n",
      "counting the notches in the rim, [18] perceived that the jar had been\n",
      "handed down through nine generations. They ate and drank together,\n",
      "and after they had finished the meal, Dinawagen told Aponibalagen of\n",
      "her son's wishes, and asked if he was willing that his sister should\n",
      "marry Gawigawen. Aponibalagen, who had heard of the power of the\n",

      "leaving a gold cup as an engagement present. [19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Gawigawen was watching at the door of his house for his mother's\n",
      "return, and when she told him of her success, he was so happy that\n",
      "he asked all the people in the town to go with him the next day to\n",
      "Nalpangan to arrange the amount he must pay for his bride. [20]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the people of Nalpangan wanted a great price for this girl\n",
      "who was so beautiful, and the men of the two towns debated for a\n",
      "long time before they could come to an agreement. Finally, however,\n",
      "it was decided that Gawigawen should fill the spirit house eighteen\n",
      "times with valuable things; and when he had done this, they were all\n",
      "satisfied and went to the yard where they danced and beat on the copper\n",
      "gongs. [21] All the pretty girls danced their best, and one who wore\n",
      "big jars about her neck made more noise than the others as she danced,\n",

      "But when Aponibolinayen, the bride of Gawigawen, came down out of\n",
      "the house to dance, the sunshine vanished, so beautiful was she;\n",

      "For three months the people remained here feasting and dancing, and\n",
      "then early one morning they took Aponibolinayen to her new home in\n",
      "Adasen. The trail that led from one town to the other had become very\n",
      "beautiful in the meantime: the grass and trees glistened with bright\n",
      "lights, and the waters of the tiny streams dazzled the eyes with their\n",
      "brightness as Aponibolinayen waded across. When they reached the spring\n",
      "of Gawigawen, they found that it, too, was more beautiful than ever\n",
      "before. Each grain of sand had become a bead, and the place where the\n",
      "women set their jars when they came to dip water had become a big dish.\n",

      "\n",
      "So an old man was brought and Aponibalagen cut off his head and put\n",
      "it in the ground, and sparkling water bubbled up. [22] The body he\n",
      "made into a tree to shade his sister when she came to dip water,\n",
      "and the drops of blood as they touched the ground were changed into\n",
      "valuable beads. Even the path from the spring to the house was covered\n",
      "with big plates, and everything was made beautiful for Aponibolinayen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now during all this time Aponibolinayen had kept her face covered so\n",
      "that she had never seen her husband, for although he was a handsome\n",
      "man, one of the pretty girls who was jealous of the bride had told\n",
      "her that he had three noses, and she was afraid to look at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "After her people had all returned to their homes, she grew very\n",
      "unhappy, and when her mother-in-law commanded her to cook she had\n",
      "to feel her way around, for she would not uncover her face. Finally\n",
      "she became so sad that she determined to run away. One night when all\n",
      "were asleep, she used magical power and changed herself into oil. [23]\n",
      "Then she slid through the bamboo floor and made her escape without\n",
      "anyone seeing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "On and on she went until she came to the middle of the jungle, and\n",
      "then she met a wild rooster who asked her where she was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am running away from my husband,\" replied Aponibolinayen, \"for he\n",
      "has three noses and I do not want to live with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the rooster, \"some crazy person must have told you that. Do\n",
      "not believe it. Gawigawen is a handsome man, for I have often seen\n",
      "him when he comes here to snare chickens.\" [24]\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aponibolinayen paid no heed to the rooster, and she went on\n",
      "until she reached a big tree where perched a monkey, and he also\n",
      "asked where she was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am running away from my husband,\" answered the girl, \"for he has\n",
      "three noses and I do not want to live with him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, do not believe that,\" said the monkey. \"Someone who told you\n",
      "that must have wanted to marry him herself, for he is a handsome man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Aponibolinayen went on until she came to the ocean, and then,\n",
      "as she could go no farther, she sat down to rest. As she sat there\n",
      "pondering what she should do, a carabao [25] came along, and thinking\n",
      "that she would ride a while she climbed up on its back. No sooner had\n",
      "she done so than the animal plunged into the water and swam with her\n",
      "until they reached the other side of the great ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "There they came to a large orange tree, and the carabao told her to\n",
      "eat some of the luscious fruit while he fed on the grass nearby. As\n",
      "soon as he had left her, however, he ran straight to his master,\n",
      "Kadayadawan, and told him of the beautiful girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kadayadawan was very much interested and quickly combed his hair and\n",
      "oiled it, put on his striped coat [26] and belt, and went with the\n",
      "carabao to the orange tree. Aponibolinayen, looking down from her\n",
      "place in the tree, was surprised to see a man coming with her friend,\n",
      "the carabao, but as they drew near, she began talking with him, and\n",
      "soon they became acquainted. Before long, Kadayadawan had persuaded\n",
      "the girl to become his wife, and he took her to his home. From that\n",
      "time every night his house looked as if it was on fire, because of\n",
      "the beauty of his bride.\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had been married for some time, Kadayadawan and\n",
      "Aponibolinayen decided to make a ceremony [27] for the spirits, so\n",
      "they called the magic betel-nuts [28] and oiled them and said to them,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to all the towns and invite our relatives to come to the ceremony\n",
      "which we shall make. If they do not want to come, then grow on their\n",
      "knees until they are willing to attend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the betel-nuts started in different directions and one went to\n",
      "Aponibalagen in Nalpangan and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kadayadawan is making a ceremony for the spirits, and I have come\n",
      "to summon you to attend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We cannot go,\" said Aponibalagen, \"for we are searching for my sister\n",
      "who is lost\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must come,\" replied the betel-nut, \"or I shall grow on your knee,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grow on my pig,\" answered Aponibalagen; so the betel-nut went on to\n",
      "the pig's back and grew into a tall tree, and it became so heavy that\n",
      "the pig could not carry it, but squealed all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aponibalagen, seeing that he must obey, said to the betel-nut,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get off my pig, and we will go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The betel-nut got off the pig's back, and the people started for the\n",
      "ceremony. When they reached the river, Gawigawen was there waiting to\n",
      "cross, for the magic nuts had forced him to go also. Then Kadayadawan,\n",
      "seeing them, sent more betel-nuts to the river, and the people were\n",
      "carried across by the nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they reached the town the dancing began, and while Gawigawen\n",
      "was dancing with Aponibolinayen he seized her and put her in his\n",
      "belt. [29] Kadayadawan, who saw this, was so angry that he threw his\n",
      "spear and killed Gawigawen. Then Aponibolinayen escaped and ran into\n",
      "the house, and her husband brought his victim back to life, and asked\n",
      "him why he had seized the wife of his host. Gawigawen explained that\n",
      "she was his wife who had been lost, and the people were very much\n",
      "surprised, for they had not recognized her at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all the people discussed what should be done to bring peace\n",
      "between the two men, and it was finally decided that Kadayadawan must\n",
      "pay both Aponibalagen and Gawigawen the price that was first demanded\n",
      "for the beautiful girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this was done all were happy; and the guardian spirit of\n",

      "in her house. Suddenly she remembered some fruit that she had heard\n",
      "of but had never seen, and she said to herself, \"Oh, I wish I had\n",
      "some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aponibolinayen did not realize that she had spoken aloud, but\n",

      "heard her talking and asked what it was she said. Fearing to tell him\n",
      "the truth lest he should risk his life in trying to get the oranges\n",
      "for her, she said: \"I wish I had some biw\" (a fruit).\n",
      "\n",
      "Aponitolau at once got up, and, taking a sack, went out to find some of\n",
      "the fruit for his wife. When he returned with the sack full, she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put it on the bamboo hanger above the fire, and when my head is\n",
      "better I will eat it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aponitolau put the fruit on the hanger and returned to the spirit\n",
      "house, but when Aponibolinayen tried to eat, the fruit made her sick\n",
      "and she threw it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" called Aponitolau as he heard her drop the fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I merely dropped one,\" she replied, and returned to her mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while Aponibolinayen again said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I wish I had some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" and\n",
      "Aponitolau, who heard her from the spirit house, inquired:\n",

      "\"What is that you say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had some fish eggs,\" answered his wife; for she did not\n",
      "want him to know the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aponitolau took his net and went to the river, determined to\n",
      "please his wife if possible. When he had caught a nice fish he opened\n",
      "it with his knife and took out the eggs. Then he spat on the place\n",
      "he had cut, and it was healed and the fish swam away. [31]\n",
      "\n",
      "Pleased that he was able to gratify his wife's wishes, he hastened home\n",
      "with the eggs; and while his wife was roasting them over the fire, he\n",
      "returned to the spirit house. She tried to eat, but the eggs did not\n",
      "taste good to her, and she threw them down under the house to the dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter?\" called Aponitolau. \"Why are the dogs barking?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I dropped some of the eggs,\" replied his wife, and she went back to\n",
      "her mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she again said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I had some of the oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But when her husband asked what she wished, she replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I want a deer's liver to eat\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aponitolau took his dogs to the mountains, where they hunted until\n",
      "they caught a deer, and when he had cut out its liver he spat on the\n",
      "wound, and it was healed so that the deer ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aponibolinayen could not eat the liver any more than she could the\n",
      "fruit or the fish eggs; and when Aponitolau heard the dogs barking, he\n",
      "knew that she had thrown it away. Then he grew suspicious and, changing\n",
      "himself into a centipede, [32] hid in a crack in the floor. And when\n",
      "his wife again wished for some of the oranges, he overheard her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you not tell me the truth, Aponibolinayen?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because,\" she replied, \"no one Who has gone to Adasen has ever come\n",
      "back, and I did not want you to risk your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless Aponitolau determined to go for the oranges, and he\n",
      "commanded his wife to bring him rice straw. After he had burned it he\n",
      "put the ashes in the water with which he washed his hair. [33] Then\n",
      "she brought cocoanut oil and rubbed his hair, and fetched a dark clout,\n",
      "a fancy belt, and a head-band, and she baked cakes for him to take on\n",
      "the journey. Aponitolau cut a vine [34] which he planted by the stove,\n",
      "[35] and told his wife that if the leaves wilted she would know that\n",
      "he was dead. Then he took his spear and head-ax [36] and started on\n",
      "the long journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Aponitolau arrived at the well of a giantess, all the betel-nut\n",
      "trees bowed. Then the giantess shouted and all the world trembled. \"How\n",
      "strange,\" thought Aponitolau, \"that all the world shakes when that\n",
      "woman shouts.\" But he continued on his way without stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he passed the place of the old woman, Alokotan, she sent out her\n",
      "little dog and it bit his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not proceed,\" said the old woman, \"for ill luck awaits you. If\n",
      "you go on, you will never return to your home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Aponitolau paid no attention to the old woman, and by and by he\n",
      "came to the home of the lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" asked the lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to get some oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" replied\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Go stand on that high rock that I may see what your sign is,\"\n",
      "commanded the lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he stood on the high rock, but when the lightning flashed Aponitolau\n",
      "dodged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do not go,\" said the lightning, \"for you have a bad sign, and you\n",
      "will never come back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still Aponitolau did not heed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon he arrived at the place of Silit (loud thunder), [37] who also\n",
      "asked him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going, Aponitolau?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to get oranges of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the thunder commanded:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand on that high stone so that I can see if you have a good sign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood on the high stone, and when the thunder made a loud noise\n",
      "he jumped. Whereupon Silit also advised him not to go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all the warnings, Aponitolau continued his journey,\n",
      "and upon coming to the ocean he used magical power, so that when he\n",
      "stepped on his head-ax it sailed away, carrying him far across the\n",
      "sea to the other side. Then after a short walk he came to a spring\n",
      "where women were dipping water, and he asked what spring it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the spring of Gawigawen of Adasen,\" replied the women. \"And\n",
      "who are you that you dare come here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without replying he went on toward the town, but he found that he\n",
      "could not go inside, for it was surrounded by a bank which reached\n",
      "almost to the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he stood with bowed head pondering what he should do, the chief\n",
      "of the spiders came up and asked why he was so sorrowful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sad,\" answered Aponitolau, \"because I cannot climb up this bank.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the spider went to the top and spun a thread, [38] and upon this\n",
      "Aponitolau climbed up into town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gawigawen was asleep in his spirit house, and when he awoke and\n",
      "saw Aponitolau sitting near, he was surprised and ran toward his house\n",
      "to get his spear and head-ax, but Aponitolau called to him, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, Cousin Gawigawen. Do not be angry; I only came to buy\n",
      "some of your oranges for my wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gawigawen took him to the house and brought a whole carabao [39]\n",
      "for him to eat, and he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you cannot eat all the carabao, you cannot have the oranges for\n",
      "your wife.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aponitolau grew very sorrowful, for he knew that he could not eat all\n",
      "the meat, but just at that moment the chief of the ants and flies\n",
      "came to him and inquired what was the trouble. As soon as he was\n",
      "told, the chief called all the ants and flies and they ate the whole\n",
      "carabao. Aponitolau, greatly relieved, went then to Gawigawen and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have finished eating the food which you gave me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gawigawen was greatly surprised at this, and, leading the way to the\n",
      "place where the oranges grew, he told Aponitolau to climb the tree\n",
      "and get all he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was about to ascend the tree Aponitolau noticed that the branches\n",
      "were sharp knives, so he went as carefully as he could. Nevertheless,\n",
      "when he had secured two oranges, he stepped on one of the knives and\n",
      "was cut. He quickly fastened the fruit to his spear, and immediately\n",
      "it flew away straight to his town and into his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aponibolinayen was just going down the bamboo ladder out of the house,\n",
      "and hearing something drop on the floor she went back to look and found\n",
      "the oranges from Adasen. She eagerly ate the fruit, rejoicing that\n",
      "her husband had been able to reach the place where they grew. Then\n",
      "she thought to look at the vine, whose leaves were wilted, and she\n",
      "knew that her husband was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this a son was born to Aponibolinayen, and she called his\n",
      "name Kanag. He grew rapidly, becoming a strong lad, and he was the\n",
      "bravest of all his companions. One day while Kanag was playing out\n",
      "in the yard, he spun his top and it struck the garbage pot of an old\n",
      "woman, who became very angry and cried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were a brave boy, you would get your father whom Gawigawen\n",
      "killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kanag ran to the house crying, and asked his mother what the old woman\n",
      "meant, for he had never heard the story of his father's death. As\n",
      "soon as he learned what had happened, the boy determined to search for\n",
      "his father, and, try as she would, his mother could not dissuade him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was departing through the gate of the town with his spear\n",
      "and head-ax, Kanag struck his shield and it sounded like a thousand\n",
      "warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How brave that boy is!\" said the surprised people. \"He is braver\n",
      "even than his father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the spring of the giantess, he again struck his shield\n",
      "and shouted so that the whole world trembled. Then the giantess said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe that someone is going to fight, and he will have success.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Kanag reached the place where the old woman, Alokotan,\n",
      "lived, she sent her dog after him, but with one blow of his head-ax\n",
      "he cut off the dog's head. Then Alokotan asked where he was going,\n",
      "and when he had told her, she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your father is dead, but I believe that you will find him, for you\n",
      "have a good sign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He hurried on and arrived at the place where lightning was, and\n",
      "it asked:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where are you going, little boy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am going to Adasen to get my father,\" answered Kanag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go stand on that high rock that I may see what your sign is,\" said\n",
      "the lightning.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he stood on the high rock, and when the bright flash came he did\n",
      "not move, and the lightning bade him hasten on, as he had a good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thunder, which saw him passing, also called to ask where he was\n",
      "going, and it commanded him to stand on the high rock. And when the\n",
      "thunder made a loud noise Kanag did not move, and it bade him go on,\n",
      "as his sign was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women of Adasen were at the spring of Gawigawen dipping water, when\n",
      "suddenly they were startled by a great noise. They rose up, expecting\n",
      "to see a thousand warriors coming near; but though they looked all\n",
      "around they could see nothing but a young boy striking a shield.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, women who are dipping water,\" said Kanag. \"Tell\n",
      "Gawigawen that he must prepare, for I am coming to fight him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So all the women ran up to the town and told Gawigawen that a strange\n",
      "boy was at the spring and he had come to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go and tell him,\" said Gawigawen, \"that if it is true that he is\n",
      "brave, he will come into the town, if he can.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Kanag reached the high bank outside the town, he jumped like\n",
      "a flitting bird up the bank into the town and went straight to the\n",
      "spirit house of Gawigawen. He noticed that the roofs of both the\n",
      "dwelling and the spirit houses were of hair, and that around the town\n",
      "were many heads, [40] and he pondered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is why my father did not return. Gawigawen is a brave man,\n",
      "but I will kill him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Gawigawen saw him in the yard he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How brave you are, little boy; why did you come here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came to get my father,\" answered Kanag; \"for you kept him when\n",
      "he came to get oranges for my mother. If you do not give him to me,\n",
      "I will kill you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gawigawen laughed at this brave speech and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, one of my fingers will fight you. You shall never go back to\n",
      "your town, but you shall stay here and be like your father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall see,\" said Kanag. \"Bring your arms and let us fight here\n",
      "in the yard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gawigawen was beside himself with rage at this bold speech, and\n",
      "he brought his spear and his head-ax which was as big as half the\n",
      "sky. Kanag would not throw first, for he wanted to prove himself\n",
      "brave, so Gawigawen took aim and threw his head-ax at the boy. Now\n",
      "Kanag used magical power, so that he became an ant and was not hit\n",
      "by the weapon. Gawigawen laughed loudly when he looked around and\n",
      "could not see the boy, for he thought that he had been killed. Soon,\n",
      "however, Kanag reappeared, standing on the head-ax, and Gawigawen,\n",
      "more furious than ever, threw his spear. Again Kanag disappeared,\n",
      "and Gawigawen was filled with surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was Kanag's turn and his spear went directly through the body\n",
      "of the giant. He ran quickly and cut off five of the heads, [41] but\n",
      "the sixth he spared until Gawigawen should have shown him his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went about the town together, Kanag found that the skin of his\n",
      "father had been used for a drum-head. His hair decorated the house,\n",
      "and his head was at the gate of the town, while his body was put\n",
      "beneath the house. After he had gathered all the parts of the body\n",
      "together, Kanag used magical power, and his father came to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who are you?\" asked Aponitolau; \"how long have I slept?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am your son,\" said Kanag. \"You were not asleep but dead, and here\n",
      "is Gawigawen who kept you. Take my head-ax and cut off his remaining\n",
      "head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Aponitolau took the head-ax, but when he struck Gawigawen it did\n",
      "not injure him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter, Father?\" asked Kanag; and taking the weapon he\n",
      "cut off the sixth head of Gawigawen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Kanag and his father used magic so that the spears and head-axes\n",
      "flew about, killing all the people in the town, and the heads and\n",

      "wizened old Alan. [70] The skin on her wrinkled face was as tough\n",
      "as a carabao hide, and her long arms with fingers pointing back from\n",
      "the wrist were horrible to look at. Now this frightful creature had\n",
      "a son whose name was Sayen, and he was as handsome as his mother was\n",
      "ugly. He was a brave man, also, and often went far away alone to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "On these journeys Sayen sometimes met beautiful girls, and though\n",
      "he wanted to marry, he could not decide upon one. Hearing that one\n",
      "Danepan was more beautiful than any other, he determined to go and\n",
      "ask her to be his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Danepan was very shy, and when she heard that Sayen was coming\n",
      "to her house she hid behind the door and sent her servant, Laey,\n",
      "out to meet him. And so it happened that Sayen, not seeing Danepan,\n",
      "married Laey, thinking that she was her beautiful mistress. He took\n",
      "her away to a house he had built at the edge of the forest, for though\n",
      "he wished to be near his old home, he dared not allow his bride to\n",
      "set eyes on his ugly mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some time they lived happily together here, and then one day when\n",
      "Sayen was making a plow under his house, he heard Laey singing softly\n",
      "to their baby in the room above, and this is what she sang:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sayen thinks I am Danepan, but Laey I am. Sayen thinks I am Danepan,\n",
      "but Laey I am.\"\n",

      "When Sayen heard this he knew that he had been deceived, and he\n",

      "\n",
      "The next morning he went to the field to plow, for it was near the\n",

      "\"When the sun is straight above, you and the baby bring food to me,\n",
      "for I shall be busy in the field.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he began to plow, however, he cut the bamboo supports of the\n",

      "with his food, they had no sooner stepped on the bridge than it went\n",
      "down with them and they were drowned. Sayen was again free. He took\n",
      "his spear and his shield and head-ax and went at once to the town of\n",

      "Terror spread through the town. No one could stop his terrible work\n",

      "him to spare part of the people that she might have some from whom to\n",
      "borrow fire. [71] Her great beauty amazed him and he ceased killing,\n",
      "and asked her to prepare some betel-nut for him to chew, as he was\n",
      "very tired. She did so, and when he had chewed the nut he spat on\n",
      "the people he had killed and they came to life again. Then he married\n",
      "Danepan and took her to his home.\n",

      "Now it happened about this time that the people of Magosang were\n",
      "in great trouble. At the end of a successful hunt, while they were\n",
      "dividing the meat among themselves, the Komow, [72] a murderous spirit\n",
      "that looks like a man, would come to them and ask how many they had\n",
      "caught. If they answered, \"Two,\" then he would say that he had caught\n",
      "two also; and when they went home, they would find two people in the\n",
      "town dead. As often as they went to hunt the Komow did this, and many\n",
      "of the people of Magosang were dead and those living were in great\n",
      "fear. Finally they heard of the brave man, Sayen, and they begged\n",
      "him to help them. Sayen listened to all they told, and then said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will go with you to hunt, and while you are dividing the meat,\n",
      "I will hide behind the trees. When the Komow comes to ask how many\n",
      "deer you have, he will smell me, but you must say that you do not\n",
      "know where I am,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the people went to hunt, and when they had killed two deer, they\n",
      "singed them over a fire and began to divide them. Just then the Komow\n",
      "arrived and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How many have you?\"\n",

      "\"We do not know where Sayen is,\" answered the people; and just then he\n",
      "sprang out and killed the Komow, and the people were greatly relieved.\n",

      "\"Are you brave, Sayen?\" called he in a voice like thunder as he threw\n",
      "the weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" answered Sayen, and he caught the spear.\n",
      "\n",
      "This surprised Kaboniyan, and he threw his head-ax which was as large\n",
      "as the roof of a house, and Sayen caught that also. Then Kaboniyan\n",
      "saw that this was indeed a brave man, and he went down to Sayen and\n",
      "they fought face to face until both were tired, but neither could\n",
      "overcome the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Kaboniyan saw that in Sayen he had found one as strong and brave\n",
      "even as himself, he proposed that they go together to fight the people\n",
      "of different towns. And they started out at once. Many people were\n",
      "killed by this strong pair, and why they themselves could never be\n",
      "captured was a great mystery. For it was not known that one was the\n",

      "he selected the largest and best.\n",

      "\n",
      "So the brother-in-law started out again, and he chased it up stream\n",

      "\"Why do you not create water, Lumawig?\" he repeated as Lumawig paid\n",

      "came out. [102] The brother-in-law jumped up to get a drink first, but\n",
      "Lumawig held him back and said he must be the last to drink. So they\n",
      "all drank, and when they had finished, the brother-in-law stepped up,\n",
      "but Lumawig gave him a push which sent him into the rock and water\n",
      "came from his body.\n",

      "Some time after this Lumawig decided to go back to the sky to live,\n",

      "feet and a cock at her head. And as he set it floating on the water,\n",
      "[104] he told it not to stop until it reached Tinglayen. Then, if\n",
      "the foot end struck first, the dog should bark; and if the head end\n",

      "of red alternating with a like number of yellow stripes. When the\n",

      "then the top came so high above the floor that they brought a seat\n",
      "for the widow's son, and it raised him just high enough to drink\n",

      "At first he walked briskly, but as the morning wore on he went more\n",
      "slowly, and finally when the sun was high he sat down on a rock to\n",
      "rest. Suddenly looking up, he saw before him seven men each armed with\n",
      "a spear, a shield, and a sword. They were dressed in different colors,\n",
      "and each man had eyes the same color as his clothes. The leader, who\n",
      "was dressed all in red with red eyes to match, spoke first, asking\n",
      "the boy where he was going. The boy replied that he was going home\n",
      "to his mother who would be looking for him, and added:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I ask where you are going, all armed ready for war.\"\n",

      "we must kill you also.\"\n",

      "and upon looking up he saw his spear, shield, and sword which he had\n",
      "left at home. Then he knew that the command came from a spirit, so he\n",
      "took his weapons and began to fight. For three days and nights they\n",
      "contended, and never before had the seven seen one man so brave. On\n",
      "the fourth day the leader was wounded and fell dead, and then, one\n",
      "by one, the other six fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all killed, the widow's son was so crazed with fighting\n",
      "that he thought no longer of returning home, but started out to find\n",
      "more to slay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his wanderings he came to the home of a great giant whose house\n",
      "was already full of the men he had conquered in battle, and he called\n",
      "up from outside:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is the master of the house at home? If he is, let him come out\n",
      "and fight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This threw the giant into a rage, and seizing his shield and his\n",
      "spear, the shaft of which was the trunk of a tree, he sprang to the\n",
      "door and leaped to the ground, not waiting to go down the notched\n",
      "pole which served for steps. He looked around for his antagonist,\n",
      "and seeing only the widow's son he roared:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the man that wants to fight? That thing? It is only a fly!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy did not stop to answer, but rushed at the giant with his knife;\n",
      "and for three days and nights they struggled, till the giant fell,\n",
      "wounded at the waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that the widow's son stopped only long enough to burn the giant's\n",
      "house, and then rushed on looking for someone else to slay. Suddenly\n",
      "he again heard the voice which had bade him fight with the seven men,\n",
      "and this time it said: \"Go home now, for your mother is grieved at\n",
      "your absence.\" In a rage he sprang forward with his sword, though he\n",
      "could see no enemy. Then the spirit which had spoken to him made him\n",
      "sleep for a short time. When he awoke the rage was spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the spirit appeared, and it said: \"The seven men whom you killed\n",
      "were sent to kill you by the spirit of the great stone, for he looked\n",
      "in your hand and saw that you were to marry the orphan girl whom\n",
      "he himself wished to wed. But you have conquered. Your enemies are\n",
      "dead. Go home now and prepare a great quantity of wine, for I shall\n",
      "bring your enemies to life again, and you will all live in peace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the widow's son went home, and his mother, who had believed him\n",
      "dead, was filled with joy at his coming, and all the people in the town\n",
      "came out to welcome him. When he had told them his story, they hastened\n",
      "to get wine, and all day they bore jarsful to the widow's house.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was about this time that Arabian traders and missionaries began\n",
      "to establish themselves in the Islands, and soon these were followed\n",
      "by hordes of Mohammedan converts from the islands to the south. Among\n",
      "the newcomers were men who became powerful rulers, and they, in time,\n",
      "brought together many of the settlements which formerly had been\n",
      "hostile to each other and united them under the faith of Islam. Those\n",
      "who accepted the new faith adopted the dress and many of the customs\n",
      "of their teachers and came to be known as Moro.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the possession of firearms, which were introduced by the\n",
      "newcomers, the Moro grew very daring and were greatly feared by the\n",
      "other natives. And soon they began to make long trips on the sea\n",
      "to the north and south, carrying on trade and making many surprise\n",
      "attacks for loot and slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time the Spaniards discovered the Philippines, the Moro\n",
      "were a terror to the other inhabitants, and they continued to be so\n",
      "until very recent years. They became ferocious pirates infesting the\n",
      "southern seas and preying upon the rich trade which the Spaniards\n",
      "carried on with Mexico. Stone walls and watch towers were built at\n",
      "advantageous points to guard against them, but bays and creeks which\n",
      "afforded opportunities for lurking, surprise, and attack continued\n",
      "to be frequented by the treacherous warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since American occupation the waters have been made practically\n",
      "free from their ravages, but on land they have continued to give\n",
      "trouble. The greater part of the Moro now live in the Sulu Archipelago\n",
      "and on the Island of Mindanao. They range in degree of civilization\n",
      "from sea \"gypsies,\" who wander from place to place, living for months\n",
      "in their rude outrigger boats, to settled communities which live by\n",
      "fishing and farming, and even by manufacturing some cloth, brass, and\n",
      "steel. Their villages are near the coast, along rivers, or about the\n",

      "near or over the water, for they live largely on food from the sea.\n",

      "A long, long time ago Mindanao was covered with water, and the sea\n",
      "extended over all the lowlands so that nothing could be seen but\n",
      "mountains. Then there were many people living in the country, and all\n",
      "the highlands were dotted with villages and settlements. For many years\n",
      "the people prospered, living in peace and contentment. Suddenly there\n",
      "appeared in the land four horrible monsters which, in a short time,\n",
      "had devoured every human being they could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurita, a terrible creature with many limbs, lived partly on land and\n",
      "partly in the sea, but its favorite haunt was the mountain where the\n",
      "rattan grew; and here it brought utter destruction on every living\n",
      "thing. The second monster, Tarabusaw, an ugly creature in the form\n",
      "of a man, lived on Mt. Matutun, and far and wide from that place he\n",
      "devoured the people, laying waste the land. The third, an enormous\n",
      "bird called Pah, [142] was so large that when on the wing it covered\n",
      "the sun and brought darkness to the earth. Its egg was as large as a\n",
      "house. Mt. Bita was its haunt, and there the only people who escaped\n",
      "its voracity were those who hid in caves in the mountains. The fourth\n",
      "monster was a dreadful bird also, having seven heads and the power\n",
      "to see in all directions at the same time. Mt. Gurayn was its home\n",
      "and like the others it wrought havoc in its region.\n",
      "\n",
      "So great was the death and destruction caused by these terrible animals\n",
      "that at length the news spread even to the most distant lands, and\n",
      "all nations were grieved to hear of the sad fate of Mindanao.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now far across the sea in the land of the golden sunset was a city\n",
      "so great that to look at its many people would injure the eyes of\n",
      "man. When tidings of these great disasters reached this distant city,\n",
      "the heart of the king Indarapatra [143] was filled with compassion,\n",
      "and he called his brother, Sulayman, [144] begging him to save the\n",
      "land of Mindanao from the monsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sulayman listened to the story, and as he heard he was moved with pity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will go,\" said he, zeal and enthusiasm adding to his strength,\n",
      "\"and the land shall be avenged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "King Indarapatra, proud of his brother's courage, gave him a ring and\n",
      "a sword as he wished him success and safety. Then he placed a young\n",
      "sapling by his window [145] and said to Sulayman:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By this tree I shall know your fate from the time you depart from\n",
      "here, for if you live, it will live; but if you die, it will die also.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Sulayman departed for Mindanao, and he neither walked nor used a\n",
      "boat, but he went through the air and landed on the mountain where\n",
      "the rattan grew. There he stood on the summit and gazed about on all\n",
      "sides. He looked on the land and the villages, but he could see no\n",
      "living thing. And he was very sorrowful and cried out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, how pitiful and dreadful is this devastation!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner had Sulayman uttered these words than the whole mountain\n",
      "began to move, and then shook. Suddenly out of the ground came the\n",
      "horrible creature, Kurita. It sprang at the man and sank its claws\n",
      "into his flesh. But Sulayman, knowing at once that this was the\n",
      "scourge of the land, drew his sword and cut the Kurita to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encouraged by his first success, Sulayman went on to Mt. Matutun\n",
      "where conditions were even worse. As he stood on the heights viewing\n",
      "the great devastation  there was a noise in the forest and a movement\n",
      "in the trees. With a loud yell, forth leaped Tarabusaw. For a moment\n",
      "they looked at each other, neither showing any fear. Then Tarabusaw\n",
      "threatened to devour the man, and Sulayman declared that he would kill\n",
      "the monster. At that the animal broke large branches off the trees\n",
      "and began striking at Sulayman who, in turn, fought back. For a long\n",
      "time the battle continued until at last the monster fell exhausted\n",
      "to the ground and then Sulayman killed him with his sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next place visited by Sulayman was Mt. Bita. Here havoc was present\n",
      "everywhere, and though he passed by many homes, not a single soul\n",
      "was left. As he walked along, growing sadder at each moment, a sudden\n",
      "darkness which startled him fell over the land. As he looked toward\n",
      "the sky he beheld a great bird descending upon him. Immediately he\n",
      "struck at it, cutting off its wing with his sword, and the bird fell\n",
      "dead at his feet; but the wing fell on Sulayman, and he was crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at this very time King Indarapatra was sitting at his window,\n",
      "and looking out he saw the little tree wither and dry up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas!\" he cried, \"my brother is dead\"; and he wept bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then although he was very sad, he was filled with a desire for revenge,\n",
      "and putting on his sword and belt he started for Mindanao in search\n",
      "of his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, too, traveled through the air with great speed until he came to\n",
      "the mountain where the rattan grew. There he looked about, awed at\n",
      "the great destruction, and when he saw the bones of Kurita he knew\n",
      "that his brother had been there and gone. He went on till he came to\n",
      "Matutun, and when he saw the bones of Tarabusaw he knew that this,\n",
      "too, was the work of Sulayman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still searching for his brother, he arrived at Mt. Bita where the\n",
      "dead bird lay on the ground, and as he lifted the severed wing he\n",
      "beheld the bones of Sulayman with his sword by his side. His grief\n",
      "now so overwhelmed Indarapatra that he wept for some time. Upon\n",
      "looking up he beheld a small jar of water by his side. This he knew\n",
      "had been sent from heaven, and he poured the water over the bones,\n",
      "and Sulayman came to life again. They greeted each other and talked\n",
      "long together. Sulayman declared that he had not been dead but asleep,\n",
      "and their hearts were full of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some time Sulayman returned to his distant home, but Indarapatra\n",
      "continued his journey to Mt. Gurayn where he killed the dreadful bird\n",
      "with the seven heads. After these monsters had all been destroyed\n",
      "and peace and safety had been restored to the land, Indarapatra began\n",
      "searching everywhere to see if some of the people might not be hidden\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the Spaniards occupied the island of Mindanao,  there lived\n",
      "in the valley of the Rio Grande a very strong man, Bantugan, whose\n",
      "father was the brother of the earthquake and thunder. [146]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Sultan of the Island [147] had a beautiful daughter whom\n",
      "Bantugan wished to marry, but the home of the Sultan was far off,\n",
      "and whoever went to carry Bantugan's proposal would have a long and\n",
      "hazardous journey. All the head men consulted together regarding who\n",
      "should be sent, and at last it was decided that Bantugan's own son,\n",
      "Balatama, was the one to go. Balatama was young but he was strong and\n",
      "brave, and when the arms of his father were given him to wear on the\n",
      "long journey his heart swelled with pride. More than once on the way,\n",
      "however, his courage was tried, and only the thought of his brave\n",
      "father gave him strength to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once he came to a wooden fence which surrounded a stone in the form of\n",
      "a man, and as it was directly in his path he drew his fighting knife\n",
      "to cut down the fence. Immediately the air became as black as night\n",
      "and stones rained down as large as houses. This made Balatama cry, but\n",
      "he protected himself with his father's shield and prayed, calling on\n",
      "the winds from the homeland until they came and cleared the air again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Balatama encountered a great snake [148] in the road,\n",
      "and it inquired his errand. When told, the snake said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You cannot go on, for I am guard of this road and no one can pass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The animal made a move to seize him, but with one stroke of his\n",
      "fighting knife the boy cut the snake into two pieces, one of which\n",
      "he threw into the sea and the other into the mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "After many days the weary lad came to a high rock in the road,\n",
      "which glistened in the sunlight. From the top he could look down\n",
      "into the city for which he was bound. It was a splendid place with\n",
      "ten harbors. Standing out from the other houses was one of crystal\n",
      "and another of pure gold. Encouraged by this sight he went on, but\n",
      "though it seemed but a short distance, it was some time before he at\n",
      "last stood at the gate of the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long after this, however, before Balatama had made known his\n",

      "\"You, my friends, decide whether or not I shall give the hand of my\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Said one, \"I do not see how Bantugan can marry the Sultan's daughter\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the son of Bantugan, \"I am here to learn what you want\n",
      "and to say whether or not it can be given.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a second man spoke: \"You must give a great yard with a floor of\n",
      "gold, which must be three feet thick.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All this can be given,\" answered the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the sister of the Princess said: \"The gifts must be as many as\n",
      "the blades of grass in our city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It shall be granted,\" said Balatama.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must give a bridge built of stone to cross the great river,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All this can be done,\" said Balatama. \"My uncles will give all save\n",
      "the statue of gold, and that I shall give myself. But first I must\n",
      "go to my father's town to secure it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this they were angry and declared that he had made sport of them\n",
      "and unless he produced the statue at once they would kill him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I give you the statue now,\" said he, \"there will come dreadful\n",
      "storms, rain, and darkness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But they only laughed at him and insisted on having the statue,\n",
      "so he reached in his helmet and drew it forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately the earth began to quake. A great storm arose, and stones\n",
      "as large as houses rained until the Sultan called to Balatama to put\n",
      "back the statue lest they all be killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would not believe what I told you,\" said the boy; \"and now I am\n",
      "going to let the storm continue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Sultan begged him and promised that Bantugan might marry his\n",
      "daughter with no other gifts at all save the statue of gold. Balatama\n",
      "put back the statue into his helmet, and the air became calm again\n",
      "to the great relief of the Sultan and his courtiers. Then Balatama\n",
      "prepared to return home, promising that Bantugan would come in three\n",
      "months for the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "All went well with the boy on the way home until he came to the fence\n",
      "surrounding the stone in the form of a man, and there he was detained\n",
      "and compelled to remain four months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now about this time a Spanish general heard that Bantugan was preparing\n",
      "to marry the Sultan's daughter, whom he determined to wed himself. A\n",
      "great expedition was prepared, and he with all his brothers embarked on\n",
      "his large warship which was followed by ten thousand other ships. They\n",
      "went to the Sultan's city, and their number was so great that they\n",
      "filled the harbor, frightening the people greatly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the General's brother disembarked and came to the house of the\n",
      "Sultan. He demanded the Princess for the General, saying that if the\n",
      "request were refused, the fleet would destroy the city and all its\n",
      "people. The Sultan and his courtiers were so frightened that they\n",
      "decided to give his daughter to the General, the next full moon being\n",
      "the date set for the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime Bantugan had been preparing everything for the\n",
      "marriage which he expected to take place at the appointed time. But\n",
      "as the days went by and Balatama did not return, they became alarmed,\n",
      "fearing he was dead. After three months had passed, Bantugan prepared\n",
      "a great expedition to go in search of his son, and the great warship\n",
      "was decorated with flags of gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they came in sight of the Sultan's city, they saw the Spanish\n",
      "fleet in the harbor, and one of his brothers advised Bantugan not\n",
      "to enter until the Spaniards left They then brought their ship to\n",
      "anchor. But all were disappointed that they could not go farther, and\n",
      "one said, \"Why do we not go on? Even if the blades of grass turn into\n",
      "Spaniards we need not fear.\" Another said: \"Why do we fear? Even if\n",
      "the cannon-balls come like rain, we can always fight.\" Finally some\n",
      "wanted to return to their homes and Bantugan said: \"No, let us seek\n",
      "my son. Even though we must enter the harbor where the Spaniards are,\n",
      "let us continue our search.\" So at his command the anchors were lifted,\n",
      "and they sailed into the harbor where the Spanish fleet lay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now at this very time the Spanish general and his brother were with\n",
      "the Sultan, intending to call upon the Princess. As the brother talked\n",
      "with one of the sisters of the Princess they moved toward the window,\n",
      "and looking down they saw Bantugan's ships entering the harbor. They\n",
      "could not tell whose flags the ships bore. Neither could the Sultan\n",
      "when he was called. Then he sent his brother to bring his father who\n",
      "was a very old man, to see if he could tell. The father was kept in\n",
      "a little dark room by himself that he might not get hurt, and the\n",
      "Sultan said to his brother:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he is so bent with age that he cannot see, talk, or walk, tickle\n",
      "him in the ribs and that will make him young again; and, my Brother,\n",
      "carry him here yourself lest one of the slaves should let him fall\n",
      "and he should hurt himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the old man was brought, and when he looked out upon the ships\n",
      "he saw that the flags were those of the father of Bantugan who had\n",
      "been a great friend of his in his youth. And he told them that he and\n",
      "Bantugan's father years ago had made a contract that their children\n",
      "and children's children should intermarry, and now since the Sultan\n",
      "had promised his daughter to two people, he foresaw that great trouble\n",
      "would come to the land. Then the Sultan said to the General:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here are two claimants to my daughter's hand. Go aboard your ships\n",
      "and you and Bantugan make war on each other, and the victor shall\n",
      "have my daughter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Spaniards opened fire upon Bantugan, and for three days the\n",
      "earth was so covered with smoke from the battle that neither could\n",
      "see his enemy. Then the Spanish general said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot see Bantugan or the fleet anywhere, so let us go and claim\n",
      "the Princess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Sultan said: \"We must wait until the smoke rises to make sure\n",
      "that Bantugan is gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the smoke rose, the ships of Bantugan were apparently unharmed\n",
      "and the Sultan said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bantugan has surely won, for his fleet is uninjured while yours is\n",
      "badly damaged. You have lost.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said the General, \"we will fight it out on dry land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they both landed their troops and their cannon, and a great fight\n",
      "took place, and soon the ground was covered with dead bodies. And the\n",
      "Sultan commanded them to stop, as the women and children in the city\n",
      "were being killed by the cannon-balls, but the General said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you give your daughter to Bantugan we shall fight forever or\n",
      "until we die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Sultan sent for Bantugan and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must deceive the Spaniard in order to get him to go away. Let us\n",
      "tell him that neither of you will marry my daughter, and then after\n",
      "he has gone, we shall have the wedding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bantugan agreed to this, and word was sent to the Spaniards that the\n",
      "fighting must cease since many women and children were being killed. So\n",
      "it was agreed between the Spaniard and Bantugan that neither of them\n",
      "should marry the Princess. Then they both sailed away to their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bantugan soon returned, however, and married the Princess, and\n",
      "on the way back to his home they found his son and took him with\n",
      "them. For about a week the Spanish general sailed toward his home\n",
      "and then he, too, turned about to go back, planning to take the\n",
      "Princess by force. When he found that she had already been carried\n",
      "away by Bantugan, his wrath knew no bounds. He destroyed the Sultan,\n",
      "his city, and all its people. And then he sailed away to prepare a\n",
      "great expedition with which he should utterly destroy Bantugan and\n",
      "his country as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning Bantugan looked out and saw at the mouth of the Rio Grande\n",
      "the enormous fleet of the Spaniards whose numbers were so great that\n",
      "in no direction could the horizon be seen. His heart sank within him,\n",
      "for he knew that he and his country were doomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he could not hope to win in a fight against such great numbers,\n",
      "he called his headmen together and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My Brothers, the Christian dogs have come to destroy the land. We\n",
      "cannot successfully oppose them, but in the defense of the fatherland\n",
      "we can die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the great warship was again prepared, and all the soldiers of\n",
      "Islam embarked, and then with Bantugan standing at the bow they sailed\n",
      "forth to meet their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fighting was fast and furious, but soon the great warship of\n",
      "Bantugan filled with water until at last it sank, drawing with it\n",
      "hundreds of the Spanish ships. And then a strange thing happened. At\n",
      "the very spot where Bantugan's warship sank, there arose from the sea a\n",
      "great island which you can see today not far from the mouth of the Rio\n",
      "Grande. It is covered with bongo palms, and deep within its mountains\n",
      "live Bantugan and his warriors. A Moro sailboat passing this island\n",
      "is always scanned by Bantugan's watchers, and if it contains women\n",
      "such as he admires, they are snatched from their seats and carried\n",
      "deep into the heart of the mountain. For this reason Moro women fear\n",
      "even to sail near the island of Bongos.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the wife of Bantugan saw that her husband was no more and that\n",
      "his warship had been destroyed, she gathered together the remaining\n",
      "warriors and set forth herself to avenge him. In a few hours her\n",
      "ship was also sunk, and in the place where it sank there arose the\n",
      "mountain of Timaco.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this thickly wooded island are found white monkeys, the servants\n",
      "of the Princess, who still lives in the center of the mountain. On\n",

      "A monkey, looking very sad and dejected, was walking along the bank\n",
      "of the river one day when he met a turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you?\" asked the turtle, noticing that he looked sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monkey replied, \"Oh, my friend, I am very hungry. The squash of\n",
      "Mr. Farmer were all taken by the other monkeys, and now I am about\n",
      "to die from want of food.\"\n",

      "\"Do not be discouraged,\" said the turtle; \"take a bolo and follow me\n",

      "they dug up, and then they looked for a place to set them. Finally\n",
      "the monkey climbed a tree and planted his in it, but as the turtle\n",
      "could not climb he dug a hole in the ground and set his there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When their work was finished they went away, planning what they should\n",
      "do with their crop. The monkey said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When my tree bears fruit, I shall sell it and have a great deal\n",
      "of money.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A few weeks later they went back to the place to see their plants and\n",
      "found that that of the monkey was dead, for its roots had had no soil\n",
      "in the tree, but that of the turtle was tall and bearing fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I will climb to the top so that we can get the fruit,\" said the\n",
      "monkey. And he sprang up the tree, leaving the poor turtle on the\n",
      "ground alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please give me some to eat,\" called the turtle, but the monkey threw\n",
      "him only a green one and ate all the ripe ones himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had eaten all the good bananas, the monkey stretched his arms\n",
      "around the tree and went to sleep. The turtle, seeing this, was very\n",
      "angry and considered how he might punish the thief. Having decided\n",
      "on a scheme, he gathered some sharp bamboo which he stuck all around\n",
      "under the tree, and then he exclaimed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Crocodile is coming! Crocodile is coming!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The monkey was so startled at the cry that he fell upon the sharp\n",
      "bamboo and was killed.\n",

      "dried it in the sun. The next day, he went to the mountains and sold\n",
      "his meat to other monkeys who gladly gave him squash in return. As\n",
      "he was leaving them he called back:\n",

      "\"Lazy fellows, you are now eating your own body; you are now eating\n",

      "\"Let us take a hatchet,\" said one old monkey, \"and cut him into very\n",
      "small pieces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the turtle laughed and said: \"That is just what I like, I have\n",
      "been struck with a hatchet many times. Do you not see the black scars\n",
      "on my shell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then one of the other monkeys said: \"Let us throw him into the water,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the turtle cried and begged them to spare his life, but they\n",
      "paid no heed to his pleadings and threw him into the water. He sank\n",
      "to the bottom, but very soon came up with a lobster. The monkeys\n",
      "were greatly surprised at this and begged him to tell them how to\n",
      "catch lobsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tied one end of a string around my waist,\" said the turtle. \"To\n",
      "the other end of the string I tied a stone so that I would sink.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The monkeys immediately tied strings around themselves as the turtle\n",

      "stepped out. Juan commanded it to shake its whiskers, and when the\n",

      "started home to show his treasure to his mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way he met a friend who was more cunning than Juan, and when\n",

      "Philippines, as well as in Borneo, Java, and India.\n",
      "\n",
      "[4] The belief that beauty is capable of radiating great light is\n",
      "not peculiar to Tinguian tales, for it is also found in the Malay\n",
      "legends and in those of India. It is not impossible that they had a\n",

      "\n",
      "[5] The betel-nut is the nut of the areca palm. It is prepared for\n",
      "chewing by being cut into quarters, each piece being wrapped in\n",
      "betel-leaf spread with lime. It produces a blood-red spittle which\n",
      "greatly discolors the teeth and lips, and it is used extensively\n",
      "throughout the Philippines. While it appears to have been in common\n",
      "use among the Tinguian at the time these stories originated, it has\n",
      "now been displaced by tobacco, except at ceremonies when it is prepared\n",
      "for chewing; it is also placed on the animals offered for sacrifice to\n",
      "the spirits. Throughout the tales great significance is given to the\n",
      "chewing of betel-nuts before names are told or introductions given,\n",
      "while from the quids and spittle it appears to have been possible to\n",
      "foretell events and establish relationships.\n",

      "[8] It is the present custom of the Tinguian to make numerous\n",
      "ceremonies for the spirits. These vary in length from a few hours\n",
      "to seventeen days. During this period animals are slaughtered,\n",
      "small houses are built, mediums deliver messages from the spirits,\n",
      "and there is much feasting and dancing.\n",

      "[9] When ripe, the betel-nut is covered with a golden husk, and it\n",
      "is possibly because of this that they were said to be covered with\n",
      "gold. The present-day Tinguian, in place of sending the betel-nut,\n",
      "sends a small piece of gold to any relative or friend whom he specially\n",
      "wishes to induce to attend a ceremony.\n",

      "[10] This seems to be peculiar to Tinguian folk-lore.\n",

      "times this was considered very necessary, as it still is among the\n",

      "and his experiences are well known to all the people.\n",
      "\n",

      "the Tinguian custom of paying a marriage price is introduced.\n",
      "\n",

      "cleverness of the small animal causes him to triumph over the strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "[89] The Tinguian house contains neither tables nor chairs. The people\n",
      "usually squat on the floor, sitting on their heels; if anything is\n",
      "used as a seat it is a bit of cocoanut shell or a small block of wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "[90] Here we have a proverbial tale, one in which the Tinguian\n",
      "expresses the idea, \"Haste makes waste.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "[91] Another version of this tale is found in British North Borneo\n",
      "in the story of the plandok and the crab, while to European children\n",
      "it is known as the race between the turtle and the hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "[92] The story shows the influence of the Christianized natives,\n",

      "He married a Bontoc girl, and the stones of their house are still\n",

      "how to overcome the forces of nature, how to plant, to reap and, in\n",
      "fact, everything that they know. Once each month a ceremony is held in\n",
      "his honor in a sacred grove, whose trees are believed to have sprung\n",
      "from the graves of his children. Here prayers are offered for health,\n",
      "good crops, and success in battle. A close resemblance exists between\n",

      "came a dog and a woman, who were the ancestors of the Moro. See\n",

      "[95] At the north end of the village of Mayinit are a number of\n",
      "brackish hot springs, and from these the people secure the salt\n",
      "which has made the spot famous for miles around. Stones are placed in\n",
      "the shallow streams flowing from these springs, and when they have\n",
      "become encrusted with salt (about once a month) they are washed and\n",
      "the water is evaporated by boiling. The salt, which is then a thick\n",
      "paste, is formed into cakes and baked near the fire for about half an\n",
      "hour, when it is ready for use. It is the only salt in this section,\n",
      "and is in great demand. Even hostile tribes come to a hill overlooking\n",
      "the town and call down, then deposit whatever they have for trade and\n",

      "north of the village they dig a reddish-brown clay, which they mix\n",
      "with a bluish mineral gathered on another hillside. When thoroughly\n",
      "mixed, this clay is placed on a board on the ground, and the potter,\n",
      "kneeling before it, begins her moulding. Great patience and skill\n",
      "are required to bring the vessel to the desired shape. When it is\n",
      "completed it is set in the sun to dry for two or three days, after\n",
      "which it is ready for the baking. The new pots are piled tier above\n",
      "tier on the ground and blanketed with grass tied into bundles. Then\n",

      "there was no place for the fire to stay, so it went into the bamboo,\n",

      "necessary to prepare them ahead of time. After the body is put in, the\n",
      "cover is tied on with rattan and the chinks sealed with mud and lime.\n",

      "of the custom of head-hunting, which plays such an important part\n",

      "since Lumawig lived on earth and taught them to go to war, and they\n",

      "[117] This celestial myth accounts for a number of constellations which\n",
      "are of great importance to the Bukidnon. Magbangal appears in the sky\n",
      "in almost dipper shape, the handle being formed by his one remaining\n",
      "arm. To the west and nearly above him is a V-shaped constellation which\n",
      "is believed to be the jaw of one of the pigs which he killed. Still\n",
      "farther to the west appears the hill on which he hunted, while\n",
      "three groups of stars which toward dawn seem to be following him are\n",
      "said to be his hatchet, the bamboo pole in which he carried water,\n",
      "and his large pet lizard. It is the appearance and position of these\n",
      "constellations in the sky that show the Bukidnon when it is the time\n",
      "to clear land for the yearly crops and to plant the grain; and since\n",
      "this knowledge is of the utmost importance to the people, they feel\n",

      "[120] Monkeys are numerous throughout the Philippines, and it is\n",
      "doubtless their human appearance and actions that have caused the\n",
      "different tribes to try to account for their origin from man. Here\n",
      "we have the most likely way that the Bukidnon can see for their coming.\n",
      "\n",

      "[124] This is a good example of the way in which people at a certain\n",
      "stage try to account for their surroundings. Nearly all consider\n",
      "themselves  the original people. We find the Bagobo no exception\n",
      "to this. In this tale, which is evidently very old, they account\n",
      "for themselves and their neighbors, and then, to meet present needs,\n",

      "and one big red or yellow eye. He has big feet and fingers, but\n",

      "a tale with which it has no logical connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "[128] This story is well known among the Bilaan, who are one of\n",
      "the tribes least influenced by the Spaniards, and yet it bears so\n",
      "many incidents similar to biblical accounts that there is a strong\n",
      "suggestion of Christian influence. It is possible that these ideas\n",
      "came through the Mohammedan Moro.\n",

      "right side, it is a good sign, but if it is on the left, in back,\n",

      "[139] The Subanun have adopted the Moro dress, which consists\n",
      "of long trousers and a coat. The tale shows strong Moro influence\n",
      "throughout. Seven is a mystic and magical number among the Malay. It\n",
      "is constantly used in divination and magical practices and repeatedly\n",

      "[140] No tales illustrate to better advantage the persistence of old\n",
      "stories and beliefs than do these of the Moro. They are permeated with\n",
      "incidents very similar to those still found among the pagan tribes of\n",
      "the Archipelago, while associated with these are the spirits and demons\n",

      "animals and commanding the forces of nature to come to their aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "[149] This tale told by the Ilocano is well known among both the\n",
      "Christianized and the wild tribes of the Philippines, and also in\n",
      "Borneo and Java. However, the Ilocano is the only version, so far as\n",
      "known, which has the explanatory element: the reason is given here why\n",
      "monkeys do not eat meat. The turtle is accredited with extraordinary\n",
      "sagacity and cunning. It is another example of the type of tale showing\n",

      "[152] Here we have an excellent illustration of how a story brought in\n",
      "by the Spaniards has been worked over into Philippine setting. This\n",
      "is doubtless the classical story of Midas, but since the ass is\n",
      "practically unknown in the Philippines, horns (probably carabao\n",
      "horns) have been substituted for the ass's ears, which grew on Midas'\n",
      "head. Likewise the bamboo, which grows in abundance, takes the place\n",
      "of the reeds in the original tale.\n",
      "\n",

      "[160] These Visayan tales reflect old beliefs covered with a veneer\n",
      "of European ideas. The Visayan still holds to many of the old\n",

      "Smiley the Bunny\n",
      "by Earl Vickers\n",
      "from Boring Bedtime Stories — An Anthology for Insomniacs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once upon a time there was a bunny rabbit named Smiley. Smiley had big teeth, long ears and a little cotton-ball tail. The reason she was named Smiley is because she loved to smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day, Smiley would go hopping through the fields, eating clover. She was very quiet, but if her motions made a sound, they would sound something like: “hippety-hoppety, hippety-hoppety, hippety-hoppety,” and so on, all the day long. This made Smiley smile, to think about how her motions might sound if they did in fact make a sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Smiley found a clover field she had never seen before. Something seemed different about this field. Smiley entered the field slowly, cautiously, sniffing around here and there, hither and yon, near and far, back and forth, side to side, etc. She wondered if the field was magic or enchanted or something like that. But no, it was just an ordinary field.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this got Smiley to thinking. Maybe there was a magic or otherwise enchanted field somewhere. There must be. She talked to her bunny rabbit friends (actually, wiggled her nose at them, since bunny rabbits can’t talk), and they all agreed that there must be a magic or otherwise enchanted field. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smiley was determined to find it. So she set off early the next morning, wearing only the aforementioned smile, plus her bunny hair, teeth, tail, ears and whatnot, and tried to find the magic or otherwise enchanted field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of hopping along the so-called bunny trail, Smiley hopped along any trails she happened to find, including but not limited to deer trails, goat trails, sheep trails, snail trails, walrus trails, people trails, hippopotamus trails, cow trails, pig trails, dog trails, elk trails, llama trails, alpaca trails, did I mention goat trails already, kangaroo trails, and so on. But Smiley didn’t find any magic or otherwise enchanted field. She was starting to wonder if there really was a magic or otherwise enchanted field, or if this was just a story she had read once upon a time. She was getting tired of this quest. “It’s hopeless,” Smiley thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "She decided she would take one more trail, and if it didn’t lead to the magic or otherwise enchanted field, she would give up. That would be so embarrassing, to admit to her friends that her quest had been for nothing. Smiley sure hoped this last trail would lead to the magic or otherwise enchanted field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiley hopped down the next trail. She could tell it was a sheep trail, because there was a big sign, written in a language that only sheep could understand, saying “Sheep Trail.” Smiley briefly wondered how she could read the sign if in fact it was written in a language that only sheep could understand, but she wasn’t the kind of rabbit who wastes time pondering imponderables. For example, she had never spent much time calculating how many angels could hop on the head of a pin, or the median amount of wood the average wood chuck would chuck, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyhoo, Smiley hopped down the sheep trail, until finally she came to a big white fence. She didn’t see any sheep, but she could tell they had been there, because there were fluffy white clumps of wool here and there on top of the fence. The wool smelled just like sleep. Hoppy, or whatever her name was, laid down for a minute, because she was tired from a long day of hopping down the non-bunny trails. She closed her eyes and imagined what it would be like to watch all those sheep, jumping over the fence. She could see them in her mind’s eye. She started counting them: one, two, three, one, two, three. Hoppy could only count to three, so she kept having to start over: one two three, one, two, three. It was easier that way, Hoppy rationalized, not having so many numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hoppy yawned. She wondered if she would ever find the enchanted waterfall. It didn’t matter. Look at all the soft and fluffy sheep. It made Hoppy wonder why wool is so itchy. But Hoppy couldn’t quite go back to sleep. So she continued watching and counting: one, two, three, one, two, three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she climbed up on a sheep’s back and hopped right over the fence into Sleepyland. Everything was nice and slow in Sleepyland, and no one expected you to be able to count over three. Hoppy liked it very much. She thought to herself, “Maybe this is the magic kingdom or lantern I was looking for.” Hoppy checked her pockets and counted her change: one, two, three, one, two, three... Everything seemed to be in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ Perhaps I’ll just take a little nap,” Hoppy said. All the sheep agreed. They curled up all around her and everything was warm and fluffy, like cotton candy if it was fluffy instead of sticky. Fluffy was so contented now. Life was good, at least at times like this, and if this wasn’t the Splendid Goulash she had been seeking, she could always look for it again tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since that day, Fluffy went all hippety-hoppety, down bunny and non-bunny trails alike, secure in the knowledge that, wherever she went, there she was. This made Fluffy smile a big, toothy grin. And ever since that day, she went by the name Smiley, and sometimes Flopsy.\n",

      "The Most Boring Thing Ever Written\n",
      "I am writing something. Yes, I plan to make it the most boring thing ever written. I go to the store. A car is parked. Many cars are parked or moving. Some are blue. Some are tan. They have windows. In the store, there are items for sale. These include such things as soap, detergent, magazines, and lettuce. You can enhance your life with these products. Soap can be used for bathing, be it in a bathtub or in a shower. Apply the soap to your body and rinse. Detergent is used to wash clothes. Place your dirty clothes into a washing machine and add some detergent as directed on the box. Select the appropriate settings on your washing machine and you should be ready to begin. Magazines are stapled reading material made with glossy paper, and they cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from news and politics to business and stock market information. Some magazines are concerned with more recreational topics, like sports card collecting or different kinds of hairstyles. Lettuce is a vegetable. It is usually green and leafy, and is the main ingredient of salads. You may have an appliance at home that can quickly shred lettuce for use in salads. Lettuce is also used as an optional item for hamburgers and deli sandwiches. Some people even eat lettuce by itself. I have not done this. So you can purchase many types of things at stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I drive around, I sometimes notice the houses and buildings all around. There are also pieces of farm land that are very large. Houses can be built from different kinds of materials. The most common types are brick, wood, and vinyl or synthetic siding. Houses have lawns that need to be tended. Lawns need to be mowed regularly. Most people use riding lawnmowers to do this. You can also use a push mower. These come in two varieties: gas-powered and manual. You don’t see manual push-mowers very much anymore, but they are a good option if you do not want to pollute the air with smoke from a gas-powered lawnmower. I notice that many families designate the lawnmowing responsibility to a teenager in the household. Many of these teenagers are provided with an allowance for mowing the yard, as well as performing other chores, like taking out the trash, washing the dishes, making their bed, and keeping the house organized. Allowances are small amounts of money given by parents to their children, usually on a weekly basis. These usually range from 5 dollars to 15 dollars, sometimes even 20 dollars. Many parents feel that teenagers can learn financial responsibility with this system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I will talk about farm land. Farm land can be identified by some common features. They almost always consist of a very large patch of dirt with small green plants lined up in very long rows. You may sometimes see farm equipment riding over these rows, like tractors or combines. These machines help farmers grow more crops in less time. They are a very helpful invention. Some different types of crops are soybeans, cotton, corn, tomatoes, tobacco, and lettuce (which I mentioned earlier). Most crops are used as food, and can be defined as either fruits or vegetables. Some are commonly eaten raw, after being rinsed in water to remove any dirt. Some are often cooked, which helps give them a more pleasant taste and makes them easier to chew. A very versatile vegetable is the potato. It can be eaten raw, or it can be cooked in a variety of ways. They can be baked, and many people like to add butter to them. They can be mashed, and a lot of times brown gravy or milk gravy is poured on top of them. They can be cut into thin strips and fried. Typically a large amount of grease is required to prepare potatoes in this style, but they are easy to make and easy to eat. You can order them at several fast-food restaurants. Potatoes can also be boiled, stewed, and scalloped. There is a wide variety of options available to you when cooking potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other types of crops grown on farm land are used for other purposes. Cotton is used to make clothing (which I also mentioned earlier). It is a very versatile and inexpensive material for clothes. Such items as shirts, pants, socks, and underwear can be made from cotton. The process of converting cotton from a cotton plant to clothing is fairly complicated. Today, cotton is harvested more efficiently through the use of the cotton gin, invented by Eli Whitney many years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tobacco is another type of crop. It is used in making cigarettes. A lot of people smoke cigarettes, even though many medical sources have identified them as harmful to people’s health. Warnings are printed on cigarette packages reminding people of possible dangers resulting from smoking. Cigarettes are available in several brands, including Marlboro, Salem, and Virginia Slims. There is a brand called Kool, but I don’t know whether they are still available at most outlets. Tobacco farming is a large industry, and currently there is debate about it. Recently the government decided on some regulations that cost tobacco companies a large amount of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you notice, some farm lands have animals living on them. Most of these are cows, and there are also pigs, sheep, and goats living on farms. Some are raised for the milk they provide. This milk goes through several processes to ensure that it is not contaminated before it is made available to consumers at stores (which I mentioned earlier). Another use for farm animals is meat. Three popular types of meat are beef, pork, and chicken. Beef comes from cows. Pork comes from pigs. Chicken comes from chickens, but you probably knew that. These animals are raised to become plump and healthy, then they are killed, sometimes at slaughter houses. The meat is then removed from their bodies, cleaned, and made available at a variety of stores and restaurants. Sometimes this process can seem gross, but it is part of an advanced ecological food chain on earth. Just like birds eat worms and tigers eat deer, human beings eat cows and pigs. The main difference is that we don’t eat animals raw. We cook the meat to remove blood, fat, and germs from it. We also season our meat with salt or different kinds of sauces. The end result is food that is very tasty and is healthy for us.\n",

The mere mention of his research would inevitably bring about a minor epidemic of uncontrollable yawns, whether behind his back, disguised by a hand, or right to his face. In this way he had ruined countless conventions, meetings, concerts, bachelor parties and wedding receptions, until the number of invitations, both social and professional, had dwindled to nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was doubly unfortunate, because while they lasted, these social encounters served as laboratories for additional field research. At the conclusion of each ill-fated encounter, he would quietly retire to a corner of the room and take meticulous notes. Sometimes he would surreptitiously time these discussions with a stopwatch, carefully noting the length of the initial gestation period, or pre-delay; the duration of the long inspiratory phase; the precise moment of the acme, or orgasmic peak of the yawn; the short expiration period; the contagion interval; and the rate at which new bystanders were afflicted. He would also gather as much data as possible regarding the people involved, in an effort to derive correlations between personality type and susceptibility to yawn contagion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realizing that most people did not share his fascination for learning about yawning’s paralinguistic value, its role as a complex arousal defense reflex, its origin in the reticular brainstem, or theories on its relation to borderline hypoxia, he had tried to spice up his discussions with famous quotations, such as Aristotle’s: “As a donkey urinates when he sees or hears another donkey doing it, so also man yawns seeing someone else do so.” He even used his joke about the pharmacological connection between yawning and spontaneous erection — \"Am I boring you to death, or are you just happy to see me?\" But without fail, the recipient of these conversations would ask to be excused and, covering mouth with hand, make a beeline for anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, his work had suffered in recent years. He seemed unable to concentrate. Often he would fall asleep in the middle of his research or while writing a paper. Even when he managed to complete an article, it was rarely either accepted or rejected — it was simply ignored, as if the manuscript had become unreadable. In the academic world of “publish or perish,” he was on the perish path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students rarely came to his office any more. He missed seeing their bright, inquisitive eyes, lighting up briefly before eventually disappearing behind heavy lids, the flame of curiosity gradually flickering in the wind of physiologic research before finally being extinguished by discussions of serotoninergic inhibition, neuromuscular spindles, adrenocorticotropic hormone-related peptides and hypothalamic dopaminergic mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had particularly enjoyed showing his students a nearly fascinating portrait that hung on his wall. This painting, he believed, should have been priceless, as it apparently dated from the time of the Renaissance, but he had managed to obtain it from its ignorant owner for a few hundred dollars. He suspected the portrait to be one spoken of by Leonardo da Vinci: “An artist once painted a picture which made everybody who saw it yawn and yawn repeatedly as long as they kept their eyes on the picture, which represented a man who was also yawning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The professor had hoped this painting would impress upon his students the reality and immediacy of the contagion phenomenon and trigger an avalanche of questions, but often the students would suddenly remember an urgent appointment on the other side of campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "His lectures had a reputation for being, if not mesmerizing, at least somniferous. It was rumored that he once managed to render an entire classroom unconscious, but this was almost certainly an exaggeration. At any rate, students displayed remarkable ingenuity in devising new ways to conceal, stifle and swallow their yawns. They developed elaborate alarm systems to keep each other awake during exams and when called upon during class. Meanwhile, students who suffered from insomnia would frequently audit his classes in search of a cure for their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one recent evening, the professor sat up in bed, reviewing his life. He recalled with some satisfaction his breakthroughs in the areas of fetal yawn research, temporary yawn-related hearing loss and hysterical paroxysmal yawning. He fondly remembered the (mostly seated) ovation he received from those still awake as he finished presenting his groundbreaking paper on the role of yawning in mate selection. While his one non-technical book, The Joy of Yawning, and his monograph “Yawn Proudly,” never quite reached the broader audiences for whom they were intended, he was nonetheless proud of his efforts to popularize the subject. He had done all one man could do. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Not such a bad life,” he reflected, stretching out in bed and closing his eyes. Soon, perhaps, the dean, the mayor, or the President would awaken him, asking for his help, something about a kidnapping or a terrorist plot, his expertise desperately needed, the megaphone or cell phone placed in his hand, his dulcet tones calming, relaxing, defusing the situation, until everyone drifts off to sleep, soft, warm, comfortable sleep, no problems that can’t wait for another day. He would sleep now, wake tomorrow to the thanks of a grateful nation.\n",

      "Multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side-by-side comparison are called aligned parallel corpora. There are two main types of parallel corpora which contain texts in two languages. In a translation corpus, the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language. In a comparable corpus, the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content, but they are not translations of each other.[1] To exploit a parallel text, some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments (phrases or sentences) is a prerequisite for analysis. Machine translation algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus which is an element-for-element translation of the first language corpus.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as annotation. An example of annotating a corpus is part-of-speech tagging, or POS-tagging, in which information about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of tags. Another example is indicating the lemma (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it, interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied. In particular, a number of smaller corpora may be fully parsed. Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for morphology, semantics and pragmatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Corpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics. The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics, speech recognition and machine translation, where they are often used to create hidden Markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes. Corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching. Corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing.\n",

      "It started, harmlessly enough, with a high-school science fair project – “Why Are Yawns Contagious?” But one thing led to another until here he was, the world’s foremost expert on a subject no one cared about, a topic equally suicidal at career conferences and cocktail parties.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "For reasons he did not fully understand, the discussion of yawning was considered almost as rude and/or boring as the act itself. The mere mention of his research would inevitably bring about a minor epidemic of uncontrollable yawns, whether behind his back, disguised by a hand, or right to his face. In this way he had ruined countless conventions, meetings, concerts, bachelor parties and wedding receptions, until the number of invitations, both social and professional, had dwindled to nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "This was doubly unfortunate, because while they lasted, these social encounters served as laboratories for additional field research. At the conclusion of each ill-fated encounter, he would quietly retire to a corner of the room and take meticulous notes. Sometimes he would surreptitiously time these discussions with a stopwatch, carefully noting the length of the initial gestation period, or pre-delay; the duration of the long inspiratory phase; the precise moment of the acme, or orgasmic peak of the yawn; the short expiration period; the contagion interval; and the rate at which new bystanders were afflicted. He would also gather as much data as possible regarding the people involved, in an effort to derive correlations between personality type and susceptibility to yawn contagion.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Realizing that most people did not share his fascination for learning about yawning’s paralinguistic value, its role as a complex arousal defense reflex, its origin in the reticular brainstem, or theories on its relation to borderline hypoxia, he had tried to spice up his discussions with famous quotations, such as Aristotle’s: “As a donkey urinates when he sees or hears another donkey doing it, so also man yawns seeing someone else do so.” He even used his joke about the pharmacological connection between yawning and spontaneous erection — \"Am I boring you to death, or are you just happy to see me?\" But without fail, the recipient of these conversations would ask to be excused and, covering mouth with hand, make a beeline for anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, his work had suffered in recent years. He seemed unable to concentrate. Often he would fall asleep in the middle of his research or while writing a paper. Even when he managed to complete an article, it was rarely either accepted or rejected — it was simply ignored, as if the manuscript had become unreadable. In the academic world of “publish or perish,” he was on the perish path.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Students rarely came to his office any more. He missed seeing their bright, inquisitive eyes, lighting up briefly before eventually disappearing behind heavy lids, the flame of curiosity gradually flickering in the wind of physiologic research before finally being extinguished by discussions of serotoninergic inhibition, neuromuscular spindles, adrenocorticotropic hormone-related peptides and hypothalamic dopaminergic mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "He had particularly enjoyed showing his students a nearly fascinating portrait that hung on his wall. This painting, he believed, should have been priceless, as it apparently dated from the time of the Renaissance, but he had managed to obtain it from its ignorant owner for a few hundred dollars. He suspected the portrait to be one spoken of by Leonardo da Vinci: “An artist once painted a picture which made everybody who saw it yawn and yawn repeatedly as long as they kept their eyes on the picture, which represented a man who was also yawning.”\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The professor had hoped this painting would impress upon his students the reality and immediacy of the contagion phenomenon and trigger an avalanche of questions, but often the students would suddenly remember an urgent appointment on the other side of campus.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "His lectures had a reputation for being, if not mesmerizing, at least somniferous. It was rumored that he once managed to render an entire classroom unconscious, but this was almost certainly an exaggeration. At any rate, students displayed remarkable ingenuity in devising new ways to conceal, stifle and swallow their yawns. They developed elaborate alarm systems to keep each other awake during exams and when called upon during class. Meanwhile, students who suffered from insomnia would frequently audit his classes in search of a cure for their condition.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "On one recent evening, the professor sat up in bed, reviewing his life. He recalled with some satisfaction his breakthroughs in the areas of fetal yawn research, temporary yawn-related hearing loss and hysterical paroxysmal yawning. He fondly remembered the (mostly seated) ovation he received from those still awake as he finished presenting his groundbreaking paper on the role of yawning in mate selection. While his one non-technical book, The Joy of Yawning, and his monograph “Yawn Proudly,” never quite reached the broader audiences for whom they were intended, he was nonetheless proud of his efforts to popularize the subject. He had done all one man could do. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "“Not such a bad life,” he reflected, stretching out in bed and closing his eyes. Soon, perhaps, the dean, the mayor, or the President would awaken him, asking for his help, something about a kidnapping or a terrorist plot, his expertise desperately needed, the megaphone or cell phone placed in his hand, his dulcet tones calming, relaxing, defusing the situation, until everyone drifts off to sleep, soft, warm, comfortable sleep, no problems that can’t wait for another day. He would sleep now, wake tomorrow to the thanks of a grateful nation.\n",
